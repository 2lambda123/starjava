This is an extracted part of Axis beta 2. 

The "axis.war" file in the lib directory is just a jar of the contents
of the webapps/axis directory. It may need cleaning up for a proper
release (there are example servlets that may be inappropriate).

A copy of this has been placed in the axis.jar file in the same
directory as the AxisEngine class. This means that the war file 
maybe located:

   URL warFile = AxisEngine.class.getResource( "axis.war" );
