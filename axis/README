This is an extracted part of Axis 1.1.  The docs and webapps directories
contain the unmodified, imported, equivalent directories from the actual
release.

The "axis.war" file in the lib directory is just a jar of the contents of the
webapps/axis directory, minus the "lib" directory, with a server-config.wsdd
file added.

The src/lib directory is a copy of axis/lib, but with the following change --
a copy of axis.war has been placed in the axis.jar file in the same directory
as the AxisEngine class. This means that the war file maybe located:

   URL warFile = AxisEngine.class.getResource( "axis.war" );

Miscelleaneous directories.

  webapps/lib is copy of webapps/axis/WEB_INF/lib, what is this for,
  I suspect it can be removed.
