This is an extracted part of Axis RC1. 

The "axis.war" file in the lib directory is just a jar of the contents
of the webapps/axis directory, minus the "lib" directory. It may need 
cleaning up for a proper release (there are example servlets that may 
be inappropriate).

A copy of this has been placed in the axis.jar file in the same
directory as the AxisEngine class. This means that the war file 
maybe located:

   URL warFile = AxisEngine.class.getResource( "axis.war" );
