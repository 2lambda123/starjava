<h4>Enter location</h4>

<p>You can load a table by typing its location into the <kbd>Location</kbd>
field of the "Open Table" dialog box.

<p>In the simplest case this is the name of a file holding the
table in one of the formats TOPCAT understands.
However it may be a URL for remote data, and in some cases
may have an additional "fragment identifier" appended to the
filename after a "#" character to indicate where in the URL or
file the table is located.
It may also be a location which does not correspond to a file
at all, such as the specification of an SQL query on a relational database.
For these more complicated cases you may find it easier to use 
one of the other methods for specifying a table to load.
