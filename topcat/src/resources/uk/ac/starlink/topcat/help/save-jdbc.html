<h4>SQL Output Dialogue</h4>

<p>If you want to <a href="jdbc-write.html">write a table to an
SQL database</a>, you can
use a specialised dialogue to specify the table destination by clicking
the <kbd>SQL Table</kbd> button in the "Save Table" dialogue box.

<p>This provides you with a list of fields to fill in which define
the new table to write, as follows:
<dl>
<dt>Protocol
<dd>The name of the appropriate JDBC sub-protocol.
    This is defined by the JDBC driver that you are using, and is
    for instance "mysql" for MySQL's Connector/J driver or "postgresql"
    for PostgreSQL's JDBC driver.

<dt>Host
<dd>The hostname of the machine on which the database resides
    (may be "localhost" if the database is local)

<dt>Database name
<dd>The name of the database

<dt>New table name
<dd>The name of a new table to write into the given database.
    This will overwrite any existing table in the database which has the
    same name, so should be used with care.

<dt>User name
<dd>The username under which you wish to access the database.
    This is not strictly necessary if there is no access control for
    the database in question.

<dt>Password
<dd>The password for the given username.  Again, whether this is
    necessary depends on the access policy of the database.
</dl>

<p>There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied for SQL
access to work within TOPCAT (installation of appropriate drivers
and so on) - see the section on <a href="jdbc.html">JDBC configuration</a>.
