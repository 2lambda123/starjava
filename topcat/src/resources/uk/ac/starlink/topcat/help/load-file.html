<h4>File Browser</h4>

<p>By clicking the <kbd>Browse Files</kbd> button in the "Open Table"
dialogue box, you can obtain a normal file browser which will 
display the files in a given directory.

<p>The browser initially displays the current directory, but this can be
changed by typing a new directory into the <kbd>File Name</kbd> field,
or moving up the directory hierarchy using the selector box at the top,
or navigating the file system by clicking the up-directory button 
or double-clicking on displayed directories.

<p>All files are shown, and there is no indication of which ones represent
tables and which do not.  To open one of the displayed files as a table,
double click on it or select it by clicking once and click the 
<kbd>Open Table</kbd> button.  If you pick a file which cannot be converted
into a table (it is not in a recognised input format) an error window
will pop up.

<p>Because this browser only works at the file level, there is a limit
to what tables it can access.  For instance if you select a FITS file,
the table opened will correspond to the first TABLE or BINTABLE
HDU within it.
For a more table-aware view of the file system, use the 
<a href="load-node.html">Hierarchy Browser</a> instead.
