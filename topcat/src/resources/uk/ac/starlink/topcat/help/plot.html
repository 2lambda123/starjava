<h3>Plot Window</h3>

<p>The plot window allows you to plot the values in two table 
columns against each other.  The window is composed of several parts.

<h4>Plotting Surface</h4>

<p>On the plotting surface a marker is plotted for each item in the
selected <a href="subsets.html">Row Subset</a>s at a position determined by the 
values in the table columns selected to provide the X and Y values.
A marker will only be plotted if both the X and Y values are not blank.
If more than one subset is being plotted, they will be drawn using
different markers.  A key on the right hand side indicates the marker
being used for each subset.  The marker types can be changed using the
Marker Type item in the Plot menu.

<p>You can zoom in and out of the plot by dragging with the left mouse
button down and right (zoom in) or up and left (zoom out) - this takes
a little practice but is easy to use after a couple of goes.
If you get lost you can push the 
Rescale button (<img src="../images/4way3.gif">) to return the 
scaling to normal.

<h4>Row Subset Selection</h4>

You can use the "Subsets to plot" item on the Subsets menu to determine
which subsets are plotted on the graph.  Different subsets are plotted
using different markers, so you can see where different groups of results
lie in relation to each other.


<h4>Axis selectors</h4>

Below the plot there are two sets of controls for selecting the 
table column which will provide the X and Y axis values.
Each one consists of two parts:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Column selector</strong>
<dd>A selection box from which column names in the main table can be
   selected.  Only columns which can be plotted from (i.e. scalar numeric
   ones) will be displayed in this selector.

<dt><strong>Log checkbox</strong>
<dd>This checkbox can be clicked to toggle whether the axis in question
    is to be plotted logarithmically or not.  If it is logarithmic,
    any negative values are simply ignored (not plotted).

</dl>

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<dl>
<dt><image src="../images/Print24.gif"><strong>Print</strong>
<dd>Pops up a dialogue which will print the current plot as an EPS file
    The plot is currently not really of publication quality.

<dt><image src="../images/Redo24.gif"><strong>Replot</strong>
<dd>Redraws the current plot from scratch.  
    This may be useful if the data in the
    table has been changed.

<dt><image src="../images/4way3.gif"><strong>Rescale</strong>
<dd>Rescales the axes of the current plot so that it contains all 
    the data points in the currently selected subsets.
    By default the plot will be scaled like this, but it it may have changed
    because of changes in the subset selection or from zooming in or out.

<dt><image src="../images/gridon.gif"><strong>Grid</strong>
<dd>Toggles whether a grid is drawn over the plotting surface or not.

<dt><image src="../images/spoints5.gif"><strong>Subset from visible</strong>
<dd>Defines a new Row Subset consisting of only the points which 
    are currently visible on the plotting surface.
    A dialogue will be popped up to ask for a name for the new subset.
    In this way points in a given region of the parameter space can 
    be grouped together.

</dl>

<h4>Progress Bar</h4>

<p>For a large table and/or many subsets the plotting may take a little while.
While it is being done you can see the points appearing in the plot
as they are done, and a progress bar is shown at the bottom of the window.
If you start a new plot (by changing the plot characteristics or pressing
the Replot button) or close the window while a plot is being done,
the superceded plot will be stopped.
