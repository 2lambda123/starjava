<h3>Subsets Window</h3>

<p>The Subsets Window displays the <a href="subsets.html">Row Subsets</a>
which have been defined. 

<p>The subsets are displayed in a <a href="windows.html#jtable">JTable</a>
widget with a row for each subset.  The columns of the JTable 
are as follows:

<dl>
<dt>#ID
<dd>A unique and unchanging identifier for the subset, which consists of
    a "#" character followed by an integer.  This can be used to refer
    to it in <a href="jel.html">expressions</a> for synthetic columns
    or other subsets.

<dt>Name
<dd>A name used to identify the subset.  It is ideally, but not necessarily,
    unique.

<dt>Expression
<dd>If the subset has been defined by an algebraic expression, this will be
    here.  It can be edited to change the expression.

<dt>Column $ID
<dd>If the subset has been defined by equivalence with a boolean-valued
    column, this will show the $ID of the column that it came from.

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<p>The following toolbar actions are available:
<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/Plus1.gif">New Subset
<dd>Pops up a dialogue inviting you to define a new Row Subset.
    You should enter a name and an expression, following the
    rules presented in the section on <a href="jel.html">Expression Syntax</a>.
    The expression must have a boolean value.

<dt><img src="../images/Column.gif">To Column
<dd>If one of the rows in the JTable is selected, this will turn that
    subset into a new column.  It will pop up the 
    <a href="synthetic">Synthetic Columns</a> dialogue, filled in
    appropriately to add a new boolean column to the table based on 
    the selected subset.  You can either accept it as is, or 
    modify some of the fields.
