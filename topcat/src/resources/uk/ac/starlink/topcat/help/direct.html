<h3>Invoking directly</h3>

<p>As long as a J2SE1.4 Java Runtime Environment is present, 
TOPCAT should run in environments other than Unix, though the supplied
startup script is unlikely to work.  In this case you can probably
invoke the Jar file <tt>lib/topcat/tocpat.jar</tt> file directly,
for instance by clicking on it or by typing something like 
<pre>
   java -jar topcat.jar [args]
</pre>
In this case however, since your normal class path (e.g. your CLASSPATH
environment variable) is ignored, it will be impossible to use JDBC
drivers, so <a href="jdbc-read.html">SQL-type databases</a> and the 
<a href="mirage.html#launch">Mirage launch</a> options will not be
available.

<p>For more control over the classpath it can be invoked as
<pre>
   java -classpath lib/topcat/topcat.jar \
        uk.ac.starlink.topcat.TableViewer
</pre>
The <tt>bin/topcat</tt> script mentioned above can be examined 
for examples of fine tuning of the invocation.

<p>The same comments apply if you have downloaded the standalone 
TOPCAT jar file <tt>topcat-full.jar</tt> - 
just use "<tt>wherever/topcat-full.jar</tt>"
rather than "<tt>lib/topcat/topcat.jar</tt>"
in the above examples.
