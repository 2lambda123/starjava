<h3><img src="../images/Help3.gif">&nbsp;Help Window</h3>

<p>A browser for displaying help information on TOPCAT.
It is probably the window in which you are seeing this text.
The panel on the left hand side gives a hierarchical 
view of the available help topics, and the panel on the right hand
side displays the help text itself.  The bar in between the two
can be dragged with the mouse to affect the relative sizes of
these windows.

<h4>External URL</h4>

<p>The help browser is an HTML browser and some of the hyperlinks in
the help document reference documents outside of the help document
itself.  Selecting these links will go to the external documents.
When the viewer is displaying an external document, its URL will
be displayed in a line at the bottom of the window.  You can cut
and paste from this using your platform's usual mechanisms for this.
