<h2>Input and Output</h2>

<p>TOPCAT can be used just as a table viewer, or as an editor too.
Having loaded a table into the application you can edit its data
and metadata and subsequently write the modified table out again,
either in the same format as it was originally read in, or in a
completely different format.  TOPCAT's view of the table while it
is running is format-neutral, so viewing and editing proceeds in
the same way regardless of the original format of the data, but it
can nevertheless preserve much of the the data and metadata detail
when writing tables out.  Editing of table data and metadata do
not (currently) modify the stored table itself; such changes
will only be preserved if the table is subsequently saved.

<p>Loading and saving tables are not done by the same components,
so in some cases a table can be read in a given format but not 
written out in the same format, or vice versa.  The rest of this
section describes the I/O capabilities in detail.
