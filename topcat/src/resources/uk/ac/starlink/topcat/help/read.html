<h3>Loading tables</h3>

<p>You can read tables into TOPCAT by
<ul>
<li>Giving the table location on the command line at startup
<li>Using the "Open Table" dialogue, which is activated by:
  <ul>
  <li>The <kbd>Open</kbd> button
      (<img src="../images/Open24.gif">) on the toolbar
  <li>The <kbd>Open</kbd> item in the <kbd>File</kbd> menu
  <li>Starting TOPCAT without a command line argument
  </ul>
<li>Dragging a table type node from the separate application
    <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/treeview/">Treeview</a>
    and dropping it on the "Open Table" dialog or 
    the <kbd>Open</kbd> button on the toolbar
</ul>

<p>The "Open Table" dialog allows you to specify a new table to open in the
following ways:
<ul>
<li><a href="load-text.html">Type in</a> the location directly in the
    <kbd>Location</kbd> field
<li>Use the <kbd>Browse Files</kbd> button to get a 
    <a href="load-file.html">standard file browser</a>
<li>Use the <kbd>Browse Hierarchy</kbd> button to get a
    more sophisticated <a href="load-node.html">hierarchical table browser</a>
<li>Use the <kbd>SQL Database</kbd> button to get the 
    <a href="load-jdbc.html">SQL query dialog box</a>
</ul>

<p>In most cases TOPCAT can happily read files or resources which are
compressed (using gzip, bzip2 or Unix compress).
You do not need to indicate what table format you are referring to,
TOPCAT will detect the format and any compression 
based on the location given.
These facilities are available because the I/O facilities are taken
care of by the Starlink generic table access library.

<p>If you successfully specify the location of a table in any of 
these ways, a new table browser window containing that table will
be opened (in addition to any existing windows you may have open).
If you choose a location which can't be turned into a table,
a window will pop up containing an error message describing
what went wrong.

<p>If you receive an <strong>OutOfMemoryError</strong> while loading
a table, you will have to run TOPCAT with an increased 
memory heap size as described in the
section on <a href="invoke.html">Invoking TOPCAT</a>.
