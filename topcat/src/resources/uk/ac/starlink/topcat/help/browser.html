<h3>Browser Window</h3>

<p>The main TOPCAT window is a view of the table which can be scrolled
around to see all the cells.  This contains several menus and toolbar
buttons which can be used to open other windows giving different views
of the tables.

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<p>In addition to the tools to show other windows, the toolbar contains
the following buttons:
<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/Open24.gif">Open
<dd>Open a new table in a new browser window.  
    Also available as the "Open" item in the File menu.
    See the section on <a href="io.html#read">Loading tables</a>.

<dt><img src="../images/Copy24.gif">Duplicate
<dd>Open a new browser window holding a copy of the currently visible table.
    This new window is not identical to the current one in that any 
    subsetting or sorting applied will be intrinsic to the new one, so
    for instance any rows not in the currently active subset can never
    be seen in the new browser.
    Also available as the "Duplicate" item in the File menu.

<dt><img src="../images/Save24.gif">Save
<dd>Write the table currently visible in the browser window to a file.
    Also available as the "Save" item in the File menu.
    See the section on <a href="io.html#write">Saving tables</a>.

</dl>
   
<h4>Menu Items</h4>

<p>The following actions are available from menus only:
<dl>

<dt>Mirage</dt>
<dd>Depending on configuration, it may be possible to launch 
    the external application Mirage from the Lauch menu.
    See <a href="mirage.html#launch">Launching Mirage</a>.

</dl>

<h4>Column Popup Menus</h4>

<p>By right-clicking on one of the columns of the table or its header 
the following actions can be performed.  
Each operates on the column where the click was made:
<dl>

<dt>Delete
<dd>Delete the column from this table.
    Any other columns which depend on it (for instance synthetic columns
    defined in terms of its values) will be unaffected.  The column
    cannot be undeleted.

<dt>Sort up</h4>
<dd>Sort in ascending order.
    The rows in the table will be re-ordered so that the row with the
    lowest values in the selected column are nearest the top of the table.
    The original row number of each row will be displayed in the 
    'row header' on the left of the window.

<dt>Sort down</h4>
<dd>Sort in descending order.
    Like <strong>Sort up</strong> but reversed.

<dt>Unsort</h4>
<dd>By right clicking on the 'row header' down 

</dl>

<h4>Subset Selection</h4>

<p>The rows displayed in this window are not necessarily all the rows
in the current table; they are those for a particular 
<a href="subsets.html">Row Subset</a>.  At the bottom of the 
window is a selector button which allows you to select which 
subset you wish to see displayed.  By default, the entry "ALL" will
be selected, which means all the rows are displayed.


<h4>Editing Cells</h4>

By double-clicking on one of the cells you will be able to type a new 
value into the cell.  Press return to confirm the edit when you have
finished.  If you type a value which cannot be understood as a legal
value for that cell, there will be a beep and no change will be made.
Currently, there are some cells which cannot be edited in this way
(e.g. most array types) and any attempt to edit them will fail in
this way.  If it looks like it has succeeded though, then it has.


<h4>Moving Columns</h4>

By dragging the column headers left or right the order of the columns
in the table can be changed.

<h4>Resizing Columns</h4>

By dragging the lines between the column headers you can make each column
wider or narrower for more convenient viewing.
