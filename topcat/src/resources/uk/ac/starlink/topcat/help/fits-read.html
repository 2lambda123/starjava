<h4>Reading FITS tables</h4>

<p>FITS BINARY and ASCII tables can be read.
Unless told otherwise, TOPCAT will display the first TABLE or BINTABLE
extension in a FITS file that it is given.
If a later extension is required, this is specified by giving the
extension number after a '#' at the end of the table location.
The first extension (first HDU after the primary HDU) is numbered 1.
Thus in a compressed FITS table called "spec23.fits.gz"
with one primary HDU and two BINTABLE extensions,
you would view the first one using the name "spec23.fits.gz"
or "spec23.fits.gz#1" and the second one using the name.
"spec23.fits.gz#2".  The suffix "#0" is never used for a legal
FITS file, since the primary HDU cannot contain a table.

<p>Compressed FITS files, or ones referred to as URLs, may be used.
