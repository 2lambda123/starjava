<h4>Saving to LaTeX format</h4>

<p>Tables can be written to a LaTeX file.
The result is a <tt>tabular</tt> environment within a <tt>table</tt>
environment within an <tt>article</tt>-type document.
You may wish to strip the <tt>table</tt> or <tt>document</tt>
headers &amp; footers from the output before inserting it into an
existing document.

<p>The output is not configurable, and is not suitable for large tables
(especially with many columns) but it can be useful for generating
output for publication from an existing table.
