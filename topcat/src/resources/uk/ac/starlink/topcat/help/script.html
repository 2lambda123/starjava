<h3>The "<tt>topcat</tt>" script</h3>

<p>If you are using TOPCAT in a standard Starlink java distribution
on Unix, you can invoke the TOPCAT application using a script in 
the Starlink java <tt>bin</tt> directory just called
<pre>
   topcat
</pre>
Invoked with no arguments, this will pop up the 
"<a href="read.html">Open Table</a>" dialogue window.

<p>Alternatively, you can supply command-line arguments giving the
name(s) of one or more tables to load - 
filenames or URLs with optional fragment IDs following a '#' character, 
or JDBC table specifiers, for example
<pre>
   topcat dsscat.xml
</pre>
or 
<pre>
   topcat cat1.fits#1 cat1.fits#2 \
          http://astro.org/data/m31.xml
</pre>

<p>In addition, any arguments which start "-X" or "-D" are passed as flags
to the Java runtime.
The main use of this is to modify the size of memory available to the
application.  By default it is 64 megabytes, but for large tables
in memory this may not be enough.  If running TOPCAT gives you
an <tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt> then you can try increasing this 
value with the "-Xmx" flag.  For instance the following:
<pre>
   topcat -Xmx512M whopper.xml
</pre>
would open the table "whopper.xml" in TOPCAT with 512 Megabytes to play with.

<p>Most of the other -X flags are only of interest for performance 
tuning and debugging; a full list can be seen by doing
<pre>
   topcat -X
</pre>

<p>The -D flags can be used for defining system properties.  One use
for this is for defining JDBC drivers, for instance
<pre>
   topcat -Djdbc.drivers=org.postgresql.Driver
</pre>
(the named driver would need to be on the classpath as well for this
to allow access to PostgreSQL databases).  Another way of defining
system properties is to put the definitions in a file called 
<code>.starjava.properties</code> in your home directory.

<p>Finally, invoking TOPCAT with the <code>-guihelp</code> flag:
<pre>
   topcat -guihelp
</pre>
causes the help browser to be displayed, but the rest of the program 
will not run.
