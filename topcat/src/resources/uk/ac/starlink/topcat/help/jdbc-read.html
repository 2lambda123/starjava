<h4>Reading from SQL Databases</h4>

<p>With appropriate configuration, TOPCAT can be used to examine the
results of queries on a relational database such as MySQL.

<p>Database queries have the form
<pre>
   jdbc:&lt;driver-specific-url&gt;#&lt;sql-query&gt;
</pre>
The exact form is dependent on the driver.
Here is an example for MySQL:
<pre>
   jdbc:mysql://localhost/astro1?user=mbt
       #SELECT ra, dec FROM swaa WHERE vmag&lt;18
</pre>
which would get a two-column table (the columns being "ra" and "dec"),
constructed from certain rows from the table "swaa" in the database
"astro1" on the local host, using the access privileges of user mbt.

<p>Fortunately you do not have to construct this by hand, there is
an <a href="load-jdbc.html">SQL dialogue box</a> to assist 
in putting it together.

<p>Note that TOPCAT does not view a table in the database directly,
but the result of an SQL query on that table.  If you want to view
the whole table you may use the query "SELECT * FROM table-name",
but be aware that such a query may be expensive on a large table.

<p>Use of SQL queries requires some additional configuration of TOPCAT;
see the section on <a href="jdbc.html">JDBC configuration</a>.
