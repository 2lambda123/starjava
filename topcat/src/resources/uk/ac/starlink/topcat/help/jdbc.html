<h3>JDBC Configuration</h3>

<p>With appropriate configuration, TOPCAT can be used to access
SQL-compatible releational databases such as MySQL.
This requires the installation of an appropriate JDBC driver
specific to that database, as well as, of course, access to such
a database.

<p>To use TOPCAT in this way you must:
<ul>
<li>Have access to an SQL-compatible database locally or over the network
<li>Have a JDBC driver appropriate for that database
<li>Install this driver for use with TOPCAT
<li>Know the format the driver uses for URLs to access database tables
<li>Have appropriate privileges on the database to perform the 
    desired operations
</ul>

<p>To install the driver you can do the following.
First, add an entry giving the name of the Driver class itself
to the "jdbc.drivers" property.  One way of doing this is by ensuring 
there is a suitable
line in a file called ".starjava.properties" in your home directory.
For the Connector/J driver for MySQL this would look like:
<pre>
   jdbc.drivers=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
</pre>
Secondly, make sure that the named class is on your classpath when
TOPCAT is run.  On Unix, do this by ensuring that the jar file containing
the driver class is one of the colon-separated entries in your
CLASSPATH environment variable.  Note that this will not work if
you are invoking TOPCAT directly using Java's '-jar' flag, or
equivalently doing something like clicking on a jar file -
see the section on <a href="direct.html">Invoking TOPCAT directly</a>
for more discussion of this.

<h4>Known drivers</h4>

<p>To the author's knowledge,
TOPCAT has so far only been used with the following RDBMSs and drivers:
<dl>

<dt><a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a>
<dd>MySQL 3.23.55 on Linux has been tested with the
    <a href="http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/mysql/products/connector-j/">Connector/J</a>
    driver version 3.0.8 and seems to work, though tables with very
    many columns cannot be written owing to SQL statement length restrictions.
    Note there is known to be a column metadata bug in version 3.0.6 of the
    driver which can cause a ClassCastException error when tables are written.

<dt><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
<dd>PostgreSQL 7.4.1 apparently works with the driver it comes with.
    Thanks to Jonathan Irwin for writing a patch to make this work.
</dl>

<p>Other RDBMSs and drivers may or may not work - please let us know the
results of any experiments you carry out.
