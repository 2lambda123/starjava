<h4>SQL Query Dialogue</h4>

<p>If you want to <a href="jdbc-read.html">open a table from an 
SQL database</a>, you can 
use a specialised dialogue to specify the SQL query by clicking 
the <kbd>SQL Database</kbd> button in the "Open Table" dialogue box.

<p>This provides you with a list of fields to fill in which make
up the query, as follows:
<dl>
<dt>Protocol
<dd>The name of the appropriate JDBC sub-protocol.
    This is defined by the JDBC driver that you are using, and is
    for instance "mysql" for MySQL's Connector/J driver or "postgresql"
    for PostgreSQL's JDBC driver.

<dt>Host
<dd>The hostname of the machine on which the database resides 
    (may be "localhost" if the database is local)

<dt>Database name
<dd>The name of the database

<dt>SQL Query
<dd>The text of the query which will define the resulting table.
    If you want to look at a table called XXX as it exists in the database, 
    you can write something like "SELECT * from XXX".
    In principle any SQL query on the database can be used here,
    but the details of what SQL syntax is permitted will be defined 
    by the JDBC driver you are using.

<dt>User name
<dd>The username under which you wish to access the database.
    This is not strictly necessary if there is no access control for 
    the database in question.

<dt>Password
<dd>The password for the given username.  Again, whether this is
    necessary depends on the access policy of the database.
</dl>

<p>There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied for SQL 
access to work within TOPCAT (installation of appropriate drivers
and so on) - see the section on <a href="jdbc.html">JDBC configuration</a>.
