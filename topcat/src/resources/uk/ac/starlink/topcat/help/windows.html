<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>When running TOPCAT can display a number of windows on the screen,
giving different views of the table data and metadata.
The principle one is the main browser window which is shown as 
soon as a table is loaded, but others can be popped up by using
the items in the <kbd>Windows</kbd> menu or the corresponding buttons in the
toolbar.

<h3>Common Features</h3>

<p>Some features are shared by many of the windows:

<h4><a name="tools"></a>Toolbar Buttons</h4>

<p>The windows have a toolbar at the top containing various buttons 
representing actions that the window can carry out.
All toolbars have the following buttons:

<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/multiply4.gif">Close
<dd>The <kbd>Close</kbd> button on the toolbar or the <kbd>Close</kbd> 
    item in the 
    <kbd>File</kbd> menu will close the window.
    When the last window is closed the application should exit.

<dt><img src="../images/Help3.gif">Help
<dd>The <kbd>Help</kbd> button on the toolbar or the <kbd>Help For Window</kbd> 
    item in the <kbd>Help</kbd>
    menu will bring up the help browser (this window).
    If context-sensitive help is available from this point
    (e.g. help about the window in which the button was pressed) then
    the browser will come up displaying the relevant page.
</dl>

<h4><a name="menus"></a>Menu Items</h4>

<p>The windows have a menu at the top containing various options 
representing actions that the window can carry out.  In most cases,
actions which can be carried out using the toolbars or in other ways
can be done from a menu too.  Most windows have the following menu
items:

<dl>

<dt>Exit
<dd>The <kbd>Exit</kbd> item in the <kbd>File</kbd> menu
    will exit TOPCAT straight away regardless of what windows are open.

<dt>Help
<dd>The <kbd>Help</kbd> item in the <kbd>Help</kbd> menu will display the
    help browser without changing its content to anything appropriate
    for this window.

<dt>About
<dd>The <kbd>About</kbd> item in the <kbd>Help</kbd> menu
    will pop up a short message about the TOPCAT application.

<dt>Display
<dd>The <kbd>Display</kbd> menu appears in most windows which contain
    a JTable - see the <a href="#jtable">next subsection</a>.
</dl>


<h4><a name="jtable"></a>JTable</h4>

<p>Many of the windows, including the main table browser window, display
their data in a Java widget called a <strong>JTable</strong>.
This displays a grid of values, with headings for each column, in 
a window which you can scroll around.  Although JTables are used for
a number of different things (for instance, showing the table data itself
and showing the column metadata), the fact that the same widget is
used provides a common look and feel.

<p>Here are some of the things you can do with a JTable:
<dl>
<dt>Scroll around
<dd>Using the scrollbars which may appear to the right and below the
    table you can scroll around it to see parts which are not initially
    visible.

<dt>Move columns
<dd>By clicking on the header (grey title bit at the top) of a column 
    and dragging it left or right, you can change the order of columns
    as displayed.  In some cases (the main browser display window)
    this actually has the effect of changing the order of the columns
    in the table; in other cases it is just cosmetic.

<dt>Resize columns
<dd>By dragging on the line between row headers you can change the width
    of the columns in the table.

<dt>Edit cells
<dd>In some cases, cells are editable.  If they are, then double-clicking
    in the cell will begin an edit session for that cell, and pressing
    return will confirm that the edit has been made.

<dt>Select rows
<dd>Sometimes rows can be highlighted; you can select one row by clicking
    on it, several by clicking and dragging over a range of rows, 
    and select an extra set without deselecting an existing selection
    by keeping the 'control' key pressed down while you do it.
</dl>

In most cases where a JTable is displayed, there will be a menu
on the menu bar called <kbd>Display</kbd>.
This permits you to select which columns are visible and which are hidden.
Clicking on the menu will give you a list of all the available columns
in the table, each with a checkbox by it; click the box to toggle
whether the column is displayed or not.
