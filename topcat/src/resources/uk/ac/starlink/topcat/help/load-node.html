<h4>Hierarchy Browser</h4>

<p>By clicking the <kbd>Browse Hierarchy</kbd> button in the "Open Table"
dialogue box, you can obtain a browser which presents a table-aware 
hierarchical view of the file system.

<p>This browser resembles the <a href="load-file.html">File Browser</a>
in some ways, but with important differences:
<ul>
<li>It shows the file system in a 'tree-like' fashion, so that multiple
    levels of the hierarchy are displayed at once
<li>It understands which items in the hierarchy represent tables and
    which represent other kinds of object (for instance plain files)
<li>It can look inside hierarchical files, so for instance it can
    investigate a Tar or Zip archive which may contain table entries,
    or display multiple tabular HDUs in a FITS file, or multiple 
    TABLE elements at different levels in a VOTable document.
</ul>

<p>The main part of the window shows a 'tree' representation of the
hierarchy, initially rooted at the current directory.
Each line displayed represents a 'node' which may be a file or 
some other type of item (for instance an HDU in a FITS file or an
entry in a tar archive).  The line contains a little icon
which indicates what kind of node it is and a short text string which
gives its name and maybe some description.
For nodes which have some internal structure there is also a 
'handle' which indicates whether they are 
collapsed (<img src="../images/treeview/handle-closed.gif">) or 
expanded (<img src="../images/treeview/handle-open.gif">).

<p>If you select a node by clicking on it, it will be highlighted 
and some additional description will appear in the panel below the
hierarchy display.  The text is in <b>bold</b> if the node in 
question can be opened as a table, and non-bold if it is some 
non-table item.

<h5>Navigation</h5>

<p>Navigation is a bit different from navigation in the File Browser window.
To expand a node and see its contents, click on its handle
(clicking on the handle when it is expanded will collapse it again).
When you have identified the table you want to open, highlight it
by clicking on it, and then click the <kbd>Open Table</kbd> button
at the bottom.

<p>To move to a different directory, i.e. to change the root of the tree 
which is displayed, use one of the buttons above the tree display:
<dl>
<dt>Selector box
<dd>Allows you to move straight to any directory higher up than the 
    current one

<dt>Up button <img src="../images/treeview/Up.gif">
<dd>Moves to the parent of the current directory

<dt>Down button <img src="../images/treeview/Down.gif">
<dd>Moves to the currently selected (highlighted) node

<dt>Home button <img src="../images/treeview/Home24.gif">
<dd>Moves to the user's home directory.
</dl>
Alternatively, you can type in a new directory
in the <kbd>Go to</kbd> field at the bottom of the window.

<p>(In fact the above navigation options are not restricted to changing
the root to a new directory, they can move to any node in the
tree, for instance a level in a Tar archive.)

<h5>Table searches</h5>

<p>There are two more buttons in the browser, <kbd>Search Selected</kbd>
and <kbd>Search Tree</kbd>.  These do a recursive search for tables in all
the nodes starting at the currently selected one or the current
root respectively.
What this means is that the program will investigate the whole
hierarchy looking for any items which can be used as tables. 
If it finds any it will open up the tree so that they are visible
(note that this doesn't mean that the only nodes revealed will
be tables, ancestors and siblings will be revealed too).
This can be useful if you believe there are a few tables buried
somewhere in a deep directory structure or Tar archive, but you're
not sure where.  Note that this may be time-consuming - a busy
cursor is displayed while the search is going on.
Changing the root of the tree will interrupt the search.

<h5>Browser Demo</h5>

<p>You can see a demonstration of the hierarchy browser working from
the "Open Table" dialogue box; use the <img src="../images/demo.gif"> button
or equivalently the <kbd>Browse Example Hierarchy</kbd>
item in the <kbd>Examples</kbd> menu.
