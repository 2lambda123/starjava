<h2>Invoking TOPCAT</h2>

<h3>The <tt>topcat</tt> script</h3>

<p>If you are using TOPCAT in a standard Starlink java distribution
on Unix, you can invoke the TOPCAT application using a script in 
the Starlink java <tt>bin</tt> directory just called
<pre>
   topcat
</pre>
Invoked with no arguments, this will pop up the 
"<a href="io.html#read">Open Table</a>" dialogue window.

<p>Alternatively, you can supply command-line arguments giving the
name(s) of one or more tables to load - 
filenames or URLs with optional fragment IDs following a '#' character, 
or JDBC table specifiers, for example
<pre>
   topcat dsscat.xml
</pre>
or 
<pre>
   topcat cat1.fits#1 cat1.fits#2 \
          http://astro.org/data/m31.xml
</pre>

<p>In addition, any arguments which start "-X" are passed as flags
to the Java runtime.
The main use of this is to modify the size of memory available to the
application.  By default it is 64 megabytes, but for large tables
in memory this may not be enough.  If running TOPCAT gives you
an <tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt> then you can try increasing this 
value with the "-Xmx" flag.  For instance the following:
<pre>
   topcat -Xmx512M whopper.fits
</pre>
would open the table "whopper.xml" in TOPCAT with 512 Megabytes to play with.

<p>Most of the other -X flags are only of interest for performance 
tuning and debugging; a full list can be seen by doing
<pre>
   topcat -X
</pre>


<h3>Invoking directly</h3>

<p>TOPCAT should run in environments other than Unix if there is a
J2SE1.4 Java Runtime Environment.  In this case however the supplied
startup script is unlikely to work.  In this case you can probably
invoke the Jar file <tt>lib/topcat/tocpat.jar</tt> file directly,
for instance by clicking on it or typing something like 
<pre>
   java -jar topcat.jar
</pre>
In this case however, since your normal class path (e.g. your CLASSPATH
environment variable) is ignored, it will be impossible to use JDBC
drivers, so <a href="jdbc-read.html">SQL-type databases</a> and the 
<a href="mirage.html#launch">Mirage launch</a> options will not be
available.

<p>For more control over the classpath it can be invoked as
<pre>
   java -classpath lib/topcat/topcat.jar \
        uk.ac.starlink.topcat.TableViewer
</pre>
See the <tt>bin/topcat</tt> script mentioned above for more information.
