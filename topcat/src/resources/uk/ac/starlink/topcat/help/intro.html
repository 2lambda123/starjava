<p>TOPCAT is a viewer and editor for tabular information.  
It has been designed for
use with astronomical tabular data, but is not restricted to astronomical
use.  It understands a number of different astronomically important 
formats, and more formats can be added.

<p>Here is a list of its main features, described in more detail 
elsewhere in this help document:
<ul>
<li>View/edit table data in a scrollable browser
<li>View/edit table and column metadata
<li>Re-order or delete columns
<li>Insert 'synthetic' columns (algebraic expression)
<li>Sort rows on the values in a given column
<li>Define row subsets in various ways
<li>Plot columns against each other, distinguishing different subsets
<li>Calculate statistics on each column for some or all rows
<li>Write modified table out in original or different format
<li>Launch other programs (Mirage)
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong>
TOPCAT is a young product under active development,
and this version is Beta software.
