<h4>File Browser</h4>

<p>By clicking the <kbd>Browse Files</kbd> button in the "Save Table" 
dialogue box , you can obtain a file browser which will display the
files in a given directory.

<p>The browser initially displays the current directory, but this can be
changed by typing a new directory into the <kbd>File Name</kbd> field,
or moving up the directory hierarchy using the selector box at the top,
or navigating the file system by clicking the up-directory button
or double-clicking on displayed directories.

<p>To save to an existing file, select the file name and click the
<kbd>Save</kbd> button at the bottom; this will overwrite that file.
To save to a new file, type it into the <kbd>File Name</kbd> field;
this will save the table under that name into the directory which is displayed.
You can (re)set the format in which the file will be written using
the <kbd>Output format</kbd> selector box on the right.
