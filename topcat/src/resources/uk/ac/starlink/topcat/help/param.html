<h3><img src="../images/tablemeta0.gif">&nbsp;Table Metadata Window</h3>

<p>This window displays any metadata which describes the table as a whole,
for instance its name, dimensions and any other parameters known.
The metadata is displayed in a <a href="windows.html#jtable">JTable</a> 
widget, with one row per item of metadata.
The important columns are Name, Value and Description, though other
columns display other bits of information about each category -
the <kbd>Display</kbd> menu can be used to reveal or hide these
columns as desired.

<h4>Editing Metadata</h4>

Values and descriptions for some of the items can be edited.
Double-click on them, and type the new value to change them.
Some however, like number of columns, are read-only and cannot
be edited in this way.
