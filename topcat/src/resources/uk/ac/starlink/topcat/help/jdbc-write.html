<h4>Writing JDBC tables</h4>

<p>With appropriate configuration, TOPCAT can write out tables as
new tables in an SQL-compatible relational database.
For this to work, you must have write access to a suitable database
and the drivers must be installed as described in the 
section about <a href="jdbc-read.html">reading JDBC tables</a>.

<p>For writing, the location is specified as the following URL:
<pre>
  jdbc:&lt;driver-specific-url&gt;#&lt;new-table-name&gt;
</pre>
Here is an example for MySQL:
<pre>
  jdbc:mysql://localhost/astro1?user=mbt#newtab
</pre>
which would write the current contents of the browser into a new table
called "newtab" in the database "astro1" on the local host with the
access privileges of user mbt.

<p>Fortunately you do not have to construct this URL by hand, there is
a dialogue to assist in putting it together.  You can use this by
pressing the "JDBC Table" button in the "Save Table" dialogue.
This includes optional username and password inputs for establishing
the connection with the database.
If you do not specify them and the database server rejects the 
connection you will be prompted for these separately.

<p>TOPCAT has so far only been tested with the 
<a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a> database and its
<a href="http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/mysql/products/connector-j/">Connector/J</a> JDBC driver.  Other databases and drivers may or may not work.
