<h4>Writing to SQL Databases</h4>

<p>With appropriate configuration, TOPCAT can write out tables as
new tables in an SQL-compatible relational database.

<p>For writing, the location is specified as the following URL:
<pre>
  jdbc:&lt;driver-specific-url&gt;#&lt;new-table-name&gt;
</pre>
Here is an example for MySQL:
<pre>
  jdbc:mysql://localhost/astro1?user=mbt#newtab
</pre>
which would write the current contents of the browser into a new table
called "newtab" in the database "astro1" on the local host with the
access privileges of user mbt.

<p>Fortunately you do not have to construct this URL by hand, there is
an <a href="save-jdbc.html">SQL output dialogue box</a>
to assist in putting it together.

<p>Use of SQL queries requires some additional configuration of TOPCAT;
see the section on <a href="jdbc.html">JDBC configuration</a>.
