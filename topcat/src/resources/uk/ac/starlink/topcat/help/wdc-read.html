<h4>Reading World Data Centre tables</h4>

<p>Some support is provided for files produced by the 
<a href="http://www.wdc.rl.ac.uk/">World Data Centre
for Solar Terrestrial Physics</a>.
The format itself apparently has no name, but files in this format
look something like the following:
<pre>
  Column formats and units - (Fixed format columns which are single space seperated.)
  ------------------------
  Datetime (YYYY mm dd HHMMSS)            %4d %2d %2d %6d      -
                                          %1s                  
  aa index - 3-HOURLY (Provisional)       %3d                  nT
  
  2000 01 01 000000  67
  2000 01 01 030000  32
      ...
</pre>

<p>Compressed files, or ones referred to as URLs, may be used.

<p>This handler is experimental; 
it was reverse-engineered from looking at a couple of
data files in the target format, and may not be very robust.
