<h3><img src="../images/fx2.gif">&nbsp;Available Functions Window</h3>

<p>This window displays all the functions (Java methods) which are
available for use when writing <a href="jel.html">algebraic expressions</a>.
They are grouped by the class which defines them, and displayed
in a tree-like structure.

<p>When initially displayed, the window shows just the names of
the classes which provide methods.
By double-clicking on these names (or equivalently
by clicking on their 'handle': <img src="../images/handle1.gif">)
you can open them up to see the methods they contain.
The listing here doesn't describe what these methods do, but the
name and list of arguments may give you a clue.

<p>Each method has a listing something like this:
<pre>
   float average( int, int )
</pre>
which means that there is a function called "average" which takes two
arguments of type <tt>int</tt> (= integer), and returns a value of 
type <tt>float</tt> (= floating point).

<p>Using the Add button (<img src="../images/Plus1.gif">) 
you can specify the name of a class to add to those available.
You should enter the fully-qualified class name (i.e. including the
dot-separated package path).  The class that you specify must be
on the class path which was current when TOPCAT was started.
It is also possible to specify classes which should appear here
by supplying their names as the values of the system property:
<pre>
   gnu.jel.static.classes
</pre>
More than one class can be specified; their names should be separated
by colons.  You can specify this property if you are starting 
TOPCAT using the <tt>java</tt> command by using the -D flag:
<pre>
   java -Dgnu.jel.static.classes=my.package.Funcs1:my.package.Funcs2 \
        -jar topcat.jar 
</pre>
or alternatively you can add a line like this to the
<tt>.starjava.properties</tt> file in your home directory:
<pre>
   gnu.jel.static.classes=my.package.Funcs1:my.package.Funcs2
</pre>

<p>Any public static methods declared in the classes specified in any
of these ways will be available for use in the expressions you use
to define synthetic columns or synthetic row subsets.
