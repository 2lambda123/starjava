<h4>Saving to HTML format</h4>

<p>Tables can be written in HTML format.
The result is a &lt;TABLE&gt; element; it is not wrapped in 
&lt;HTML&gt; or &lt;BODY&gt; tags so should really be embedded
in a document before use, though most browsers will cope with it
as a freestanding document.  The output is fairly basic, but
includes column titles, column units if present, and the table
data themselves.
