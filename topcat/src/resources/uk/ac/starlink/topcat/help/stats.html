<h3><img src="../images/sigma0.gif">&nbsp;Statistics Window</h3>

<p>The Statistics Window can display statistics for the values in each
of the table's columns.  The calculated values are displayed in a
<a href="windows.html#jtable">JTable</a> widget with a row for each 
column in the main table, and a column for each of a number of
statistical quantities calculated on <a href="#subsets">some or all</a> of 
the values in the data table column corresponding to that grid row.
The following columns are shown by default: 

<dl>
<dt>Name
<dd>The name of the column in the main table represented by this grid row.

<dt>Mean
<dd>The mean value of the good cells.  For boolean columns, this is
    the proportion of good cells which are True.

<dt>S.D.
<dd>The standard deviation of the good cells.

<dt>Minimum
<dd>The minimum value.  For numeric columns the meaning of this is quite
    obvious.  For other columns, if an ordering can be reasonably defined
    on them, the 'smallest' value may be shown.  For instance string 
    values will show the entry which would be first alphabetically.

<dt>Maximum
<dd>As minimum, but shows the largest values.

<dt>Good cells
<dd>The number of non-blank cells.
</dl>

<p>Several additional items of statistical information are also calculated,
but the columns displaying these are hidden by default.
You can reveal these by using the <kbd>Display</kbd> menu:

<dl>

<dt>Index
<dd>The index of the column in the main table, i.e. the order in which 
    it appears in the main browser window.

<dt>$ID
<dd>The unique identifier label for the column in the main table.

<dt>Sum
<dd>The sum of all the values in the column.  For boolean columns this
    is a count of the number of True values in the column.

<dt>Variance
<dd>The variance of the good cells.

<dt>Row of min.
<dd>The index of the row in the main table at which the minimum value
    occurred.

<dt>Row of max.
<dd>The index of the row in the main table at which the maximum value
    occurred.

<dt>Bad cells
<dd>The number of blank cells; the sum of
    this value and the Good cells value will be the same for each
    column.

<dt>Cardinality
<dd>If the column contains a small number of distinct values
    then that number, the column's <dfn>cardinality</dfn> will be shown here.
    If the number of values represented is large (currently &gt;50) or
    a large proportion of the non-bad values (currently &gt;75%) then
    no value is shown.

</dl>


<h4><a name="subsets"></a>Subset selection</h4>

<p>The quantities displayed in this window are not necessarily those for
the entire table; they are those for a particular 
<a href="subsets.html">Row Subset</a>.

<p>At the bottom of the window is a selector button which allows you
to select which subset you want the calculations to be done for.
By clicking on this you can calculate the statistics for different
subsets.

<p>When the window is first opened, or when it is invoked from a menu
or the toolbar in the main
browser window, the subset will correspond to the active subset in
the main window.

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/Redo24.gif">Recalculate
<dd>Once statistics have been calculated for a given subset they are
    cached and not normally recalculated again.  
    Use this button if you want to force a recalculation because the
    data may have changed.<br>
    Also available as the <kbd>Recalculate</kbd> item on the 
    <kbd>Statistics</kbd> menu.

<h4>Progress Bar</h4>

<p>For a large table the calculations may take a while.  While they are
being performed you can interact with the window as normal, 
but a progress bar is shown at the bottom of the window.
If you initiate a new calculation (by pushing the Recalculate button or
selecting a new subset) or close the window during a calculation,
the superceded calculation will be stopped.
