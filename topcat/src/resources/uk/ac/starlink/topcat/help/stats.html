<h3>Statistics Window</h3>

<p>The Statistics Window can display statistics for the values in each
of the table's columns.  The calculated values are displayed in a
<a href="windows.html#jtable">JTable</a> widget with a row for each 
column in the main table, and a column for each of a number of
statistical quantities calculated on <a href="#subsets">some or all</a> of 
the values in the data table column corresponding to that grid row:

<dl>
<dt>Name
<dd>The name of the column in the main table represented by this grid row.

<dt>Mean
<dd>The mean value of the good cells.

<dt>S.D.
<dd>The standard deviation of the good cells.

<dt>Minimum
<dd>The minimum value.  For numeric columns the meaning of this is quite
    obvious.  For other columns, if an ordering can be reasonably defined
    on them, the 'smallest' value may be shown.  For instance string 
    values will show the entry which would be first alphabetically.

<dt>Maximum
<dd>As minimum, but shows the largest values.

<dt>Good cells
<dd>The number of non-blank cells.

<dt>Bad cells
<dd>The number of blank cells; the sum of
    this value and the Good cells value will be the same for each
    column.

</dl>


<h4><a name="subsets"></a>Subset selection</h4>

<p>The quantities displayed in this window are not necessarily those for
the entire table; they are those for a particular 
<a href="subsets.html">Row Subset</a>.

<p>At the bottom of the window is a selector button which allows you
to select which subset you want the calculations to be done for.
By clicking on this you can calculate the statistics for different
subsets.

<p>When the window is first opened, or when it is invoked from a menu
or the toolbar in the main
browser window, the subset will correspond to the active subset in
the main window.

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/Redo24.gif">Recalculate
<dd>Once statistics have been calculated for a given subset they are
    cached and not normally recalculated again.  
    Use this button if you want to force a recalculation because the
    data may have changed.<br>
    Also available as the <kbd>Recalculate</kbd> item on the 
    <kbd>Statistics</kbd> menu.

<h4>Progress Bar</h4>

<p>For a large table the calculations may take a while.  While they are
being performed you can interact with the window as normal, 
but a progress bar is shown at the bottom of the window.
If you initiate a new calculation (by pushing the Recalculate button or
selecting a new subset) or close the window during a calculation,
the superceded calculation will be stopped.
