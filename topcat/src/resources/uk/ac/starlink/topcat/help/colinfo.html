<h3>Columns Window</h3>

<p>The Columns Window displays a <a href="windows.html#jtable">JTable</a> 
giving all the information (<dfn>metadata</dfn>)
known about each column in the main data table.  It may take a little bit
of getting used to, since each <em>column</em> in the main data table
is represented by a <em>row</em> in the JTable displayed here.
The order and widths of the columns of JTable widget can be 
changed in the same way as those for the browser window JTable, 
but this has no effect on the data.

<p>Each column in the displayed JTable corresponds to one category
of metadata for the columns in the main data table - their names, 
descriptions, UCDs etc.
Tables of different types (e.g. ones read from different input formats) 
can have different categories of metadata.  By default a metadata
category is displayed in this JTable if at least one 
table column has a non-blank
value for that metadata category, so for instance if no table columns
have a defined UCD then the UCD column will not appear.  
Categories can be made to appear and disappear however by using the
<kbd>Display</kbd> menu.  They can also be moved by dragging their
headers around as usual.

<p>The order in which the rows of this JTable are presented 
is the same as the order in which the columns appear in the
browser window.  If the columns are moved around in the browser
window, the corresponding rows will move around in this window.

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<p>The following toolbar actions are available:

<dl>
<dt><img src="../images/Plus1.gif">New Synthetic Column
<dd>This allows you to add a new column based on the existing ones - 
    see the section on <a href="synthetic.html">Synthetic columns</a>.
    The new column will be added by default after the last selected
    column in the JTable, or at the end if none is selected.
    Also available as the <kbd>New Synthetic Column</kbd> item in the
    <kbd>Columns</kbd> menu.

<dt><img src="../images/Minus1.gif">Delete Columns
<dd>If any of the JTable rows are selected, then clicking this button
    will delete them from the display here and elsewhere in TOPCAT
    (e.g. the main browser window).  Deleted columns cannot be undeleted.
    Also available as the <kbd>Delete selected column(s)</kbd> item
    in the <kbd>Columns</kbd> menu.

</dl>


<h4>Menus</h4>

<p>The <kbd>Columns</kbd> menu contains the following items:

<dl>
<dt>Sort selected up
<dd>If a single column is selected then the row order in the main browser
    window will be re-ordered so that the selected column's values appear
    in ascending order.

<dt>Sort selected down
<dd>Like <strong>Sort selected up</strong> but with the opposite sense.

</dl>

<p>The <kbd>Display</kbd> menu lists all the columns metadata categories
which are available.  Each of these categories is displayed as a column
in this window's JTable.  By default only columns which have a
non-blank entry for at least one table column are shown, but you
can change this by selecting or deselecting the checkboxes in this
menu.


<h4>Editing Metadata</h4>

Some of the metadata items in the JTable can be edited.  
Double-click in the cell you wish to edit, and if a text cursor shows
up there you can type changes to that metadata item.
Press return to confirm the edit when you have finished.

<h4>Column Metadata Items</h4>

<p>For each column in the data table (each line in the displayed JTable) 
items of information such as
column name, description, UCD etc are given.
As explained above, by default these will only be displayed if
they contain some non-blank entries.  Additional items may be
displayed as appropriate for the specific kind of table.
The standard metadata categories are as follows:
<dl>

<dt>Index
<dd>The number of the column in the browser window display; also the 
    number of the row in the JTable shown here. 
    This value can change for a given column if some columns 
    are deleted moved or inserted.

<dt>Name
<dd>The name of the column.

<dt>$ID
<dd>A unique and unchanging ID value for each column.   These are useful
    in defining expressions for synthetic columns, since they are
    guaranteed unique for each column.  Although the column Name can
    be used as well, the Name may not be unique and may not have the
    correct form for use in an algebraic expression.
    Initially, the Index value and the $ID value will match each other
    (except the $ID is preceded by a '$' character) but if columns are
    moved, added or deleted they will no longer match.

<dt>Class
<dd>The Java class of the items in that column.  You don't have to know 
    very much Java to understand these; they are Float or Double for
    floating point numbers; Byte, Short, Integer or Long for integer
    numbers, Boolean for a logical (true/fals) flag, 
    or String for a string of ASCII or Unicode characters.
    There are other possibilities, but these will cover most.
    The characters '[]' after the name of the class indicates that each
    cell in the column holds an array of the indicated type.

<dt>Shape
<dd>Cells of a table can contain arrays as well as scalars.
    If the column contains an array type, this indicates the shape that
    it should be interpreted as.  It gives the dimensions in column-major
    order.  The last element may be a '*' to indicate that the size
    of the array may be variable.  For scalar columns, this item will be blank.

<dt>Units
<dd>The units in which quantities in this column are expressed.

<dt>Expression
<dd>The algebraic expression defining the values in this column.
    This will only be filled in if the column in question is a 
    synthetic column which you have added, rather than one present in
    the data in its original loaded form.

<dt>Description
<dd>A textual description of the function of this column.

<dt>UCD
<dd>The UCD associated with this column, if one is specified.
    UCDs are <a href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/UCD.htx">Uniform 
    Content Descriptors</a>, and indicate the semantics
    of the values in this column.

<dt>UCD Description
<dd>If the string in the UCD column is the identifier of a known UCD,
    the standard description associated with that UCD is shown here.
