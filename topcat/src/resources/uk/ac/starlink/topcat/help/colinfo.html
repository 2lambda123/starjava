<h3>Column Metadata Window</h3>

<p>The Column Metadata Window displays a grid 
giving all the information
known about each column in the main data table.  It may take a little bit
of getting used to, since each <em>column</em> in the main data table
is represented by a <em>row</em> in the grid displayed here.
The order and widths of the columns of grid widget can be 
changed in the same way as those for the browser window grid, 
but this has no effect on the data.

<p>The order in which the rows of this grid are presented 
is the same as the order in which the columns appear in the
browser window.

<h4>Column actions</h4>

Rows of the grid widget can be selected by clicking to select one row
or dragging the mouse to select several.
When they are selected certain items in the Column menu can be used.

<dl>
<dt>New synthetic column
<dd>This allows you to add a new column based on the existing ones - 
    see the section on <a href="synthetic.html>Synthetic columns</a>.

<dt>Delete selected column(s)
<dd>Any selected columns will be deleted from the table in the main browser
    window.

<dt>Sort selected up
<dd>If a single column is selected then the row order in the main browser
    window will be re-ordered so that the selected column's values appear
    in ascending order.

<dt>Sort selected down
<dd>Like <strong>Sort selected up</strong> but with the opposite sense.

</dl>

<h4>Editing metadata</h4>

Some of the metadata items in the grid can be edited.  
Double-click in the cell you wish to edit, and if a text cursor shows
up there you can type changes to that metadata item.
Press return to confirm the edit when you have finished.

<h4>Column Metadata Items</h4>

<p>For each column in the data table (each line in the displayed grid) 
items of information such as
column name, description, UCD etc are given.
Exactly which items are shown will depend on the kind of table 
in the viewer and how much metadata it has.
Some of the items are these:
<dl>

<dt>Index
<dd>The number of the column in the browser window display; also the 
    number of the row in the grid shown here. 
    This value can change for a given column if some columns 
    are deleted moved or inserted.

<dt>Name
<dd>The name of the column.

<dt>Class
<dd>The Java class of the items in that column.  You don't have to know 
    very much Java to understand these; they are Float or Double for
    floating point numbers; Byte, Short, Integer or Long for integer
    numbers, Boolean for a logical (true/fals) flag, 
    or String for a string of ASCII or Unicode characters.
    There are other possibilities, but these will cover most.
    The characters '[]' after the name of the class indicates that each
    cell in the column holds an array of the indicated type.

<dt>Shape
<dd>Cells of a table can contain arrays as well as scalars.
    If the column contains an array type, this indicates the shape that
    it should be interpreted as.  It gives the dimensions in column-major
    order.  The last element may be a '*' to indicate that the size
    of the array may be variable.  For scalar columns, this item will be blank.

<dt>Units
<dd>The units in which quantities in this column are expressed.

<dt>Description
<dd>A textual description of the function of this column.

<dt>UCD
<dd>The UCD associated with this column, if one is specified.
    UCDs are <a href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/UCD.htx">Uniform 
    Content Descriptors</a>, and indicate the semantics
    of the values in this column.

<dt>Expression
<dd>The algebraic expression defining the values in this column.
    This will only be filled in if the column in question is a 
    synthetic column which you have added, rather than one present in
    the data in its original loaded form.

<dt>$ID
<dd>A unique and unchanging ID value for each column.   These are useful
    in defining expressions for synthetic columns, since they are
    guaranteed unique for each column.  Although the column Name can
    be used as well, the Name may not be unique and may not have the
    correct form for use in an algebraic expression.
    Initially, the Index value and the $ID value will match each other
    (except the $ID is preceded by a '$' character) but if columns are
    moved, added or deleted they will no longer match.
