<h4>Saving to VOTable format</h4>

<p>Pure XML VOTable tables can be written.

<p>A new file will be written using the given location as a filename.
This will be an XML file containing a VOTable document with a single
RESOURCE element containing a single TABLE element containing a
TABLEDATA element.

<p>Note that since the data will be stored as a sequence of XML elements
with the numbers written as text
this is not a suitable format for very long files.
