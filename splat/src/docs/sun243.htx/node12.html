Spectral coordinate system attributes window</A>
</H2>

<P>
This window allows you to define the coordinate systems that describe
your spectra. The most trivial use of these is simply to document what
type of coordinate and units your spectra are measured in, examples
are wavelength in air in angstroms, frequency in GHz, velocity in
km/s, <I>etc.</I>When supplied these values will be used to annotate any
plots, but can also be used to compare spectra in different coordinate
systems and to transform a spectrum from one coordinate system to
another.

<P>
A more complete description of the coordinate system also includes two
further pieces of information, the time and place when the observation
was made and the direction and speed of what was being observed. Taken
together these define the "rest frames" of the observation and the
source. 

<P>
In the following picture you can see that I have an observation
(topocentric) of NGC1275 (RA: 03:19:47.49, Dec: 41:30:40.5 FK5 J2000)
made in air, calibrated in angstroms, taken in June 1999 on the
William Herschel Telescope. I've also entered that NGC1275 as observed
from the centre of the Sun (heliocentric) has a recessional velocity
of 5300km/s.

<P>

<P>
To apply this to a spectrum that has no coordinate information (or
incorrect coordinate information) you need to press the
<B>Set</B> button. Note that you can apply the same coordinates
to more than one spectrum by selecting them all in the view of the
global list shown in this window.

<P>
Now say that you wanted to compare this spectrum with a standard set
of emission lines, obviously taken at rest in a laboratory. If you
load the emission line catalogue and display it in the same plot and
then select the <B>Options=&gt;Match coordinates</B> item the
labels will be red-shifted to the rest frame of the source (<I>i.e.</I> where
the lines from the galaxy originated). This is shown in action in the
next figure where the lines before matching are shown in blue and red
after matching.

<P>

</DIV>

<P>
The alternative to this method is switch 
<B>Options=&gt;Match coordinates</B> off and transform the galaxy
spectrum to what it would have looked like in the source standard of
rest (<I>i.e.</I> if you had taken the measurements travelling with the
galaxy). To do this change the <B>Standard of rest:</B> to
<B>Source</B> but now press the <B>Convert</B> button. This
remaps the spectral coordinates permanently. 

<P>
Using this method you can also transform your spectrum to other
systems and units (say frequency or energy) and rest frames (so you
can go from topocentric to heliocentric or the kinematic or dynamic
local standards of rest). With  <B>Options=&gt;Match coordinates</B>
switched on you can also directly compare spectra calibrated in all
these different systems.

<P>
When transforming to velocity (optical, radio and relativistic
velocities are supported) a rest "frequency" is also needed. 
Conceptually this is the value that the centre of a line with
locally zero velocity has. The rest frequency can actually be
specified in various units, for instance angstroms.

<P>
To find out more about spectral coordinate systems you'll need to
refer to `FITS-WCS paper III Representations of spectral coordinates
in FITS (Greisen, Valdes, Calabretta &amp; Allen)' and the Starlink AST
library documentation (<A HREF="/star/docs/sun211.htx/sun211.html#xref_ss:specframes">SUN/211</A>).
