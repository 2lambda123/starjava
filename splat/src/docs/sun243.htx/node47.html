This release (3.3)</A>
</H2>

<P>
Starlink SPLAT is now a tool for the Virtual Observatory and has been
renamed to <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.

<P>
In this release Starlink <I>SPLAT-VO</I> has been enhanced to access prototype
spectral data servers (so called SSAP servers) that are being registered on
the evolving virtual observatory. Using <I>SPLAT-VO</I> it is now possible to make
queries about a region on the sky and retrieve, display and compare any
spectra that are available.

<P>
Comparisons of such spectra are made possible by improvements to the
Starlink AST library which can transform coordinates between various
spectral systems (wavelength, frequency, energy and velocity) and between a
growing number of flux systems (currently flux per unit frequency and per
unit wavelength). This allows you to view various spectral from differing
energy domains as a spectral energy distribution.

<P>
Other changes of note in this release:

<UL><LI>Spectra can now be drawn using point markers of various kinds.

<P>

<LI>A new tool for setting the data units of spectra has been introduced.

<P>

<LI>A new tool for obtaining statistics about a spectrum, or regions of a
      spectrum has been introduced.

<P>

<LI>A new tool for transforming spectra by a redshift or by a flip and or
      translation has been introduced.

<P>

<LI>The grid drawn around the spectra can now be forced to stay within
      the visible region of the plot window. This makes it easier to view
      the spectral data values and coordinates, but at a performance cost.
      Switch on the option <B>Only display grid axes in visible area</B>
      to see this in action.

<P>

<LI>Postscript output can now be created in encapsulated form.

<P>

<LI>Dual sideband data now have the coordinates of the second sideband
      shown along the opposing X axis of a plot. It is also possible to
      switch between sidebands.

<P>

<LI>Log spacing can now be switched on from a plot (rather than by finding
      the plot configuration window).

<P>

<LI>Support for data units in the line identifier and simple text formats
      has been added.

<P>

<LI>Support for line identifiers to match against spectra that have data
      units has been added.

<P>

<LI>SED example data can now be loaded from the main <B>Options</B>
      menu.

<P>

<LI>The data and coordinate units of the current spectrum in a plot
      can now be modified to preset values quickly.

<P>

<LI>Several new smoothing filters have been introduced - Hanning, Hamming,
      Welch and Barlett.

<P>

<LI>Line identifiers are now available in the webstart version of <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.

<P>

<LI>Line identifiers that fall within range of a spectrum can now be
      automatically loaded. Other changes allow the positioning to follow
      a spectrum, have the short name shown as a prefix and use horizontal
      orientation for the labels.

<P>

<LI>Spectral coordinates can now have the source velocity specified
      as a redshift. The spectral editing tools now include relativistic
      velocities in their template functions.

<P>

<LI>The motion tracker in plot windows can now report the coordinates
      under the pointer. The default continues to be to report the nearest
      coordinate and data value of the current spectrum.

<P>

<LI>The scale factors used when drawing spectra are now related to
      graphics size. Previously they where related to the spectrum
      coordinates. This makes it easy to control the plot when displaying
      spectra with very different coordinates (like those downloaded from
      the VO), but will cause existing spectra to be re-scaled when new
      spectra are added to a plot.

<P>

<LI>If should now be much faster when re-drawing many spectra that are
      being matching using their spectral coordinates and data units.

<P>

<LI>The handling of errors when plotting spectra with hugely differing
      coordinates should be improved.

<P>

<LI>A long standing problem with graphics corruption between plots has
      been fixed. (When the current spectrum was shared between plots
      some drawing changes effected all plots).

<P>

<LI>A bug that meant that the postscript output of a plot was always
      written to the default directory has been fixed.

<P>

<LI>Serialised spectra stacks now include full coordinate information.

<P>

<LI>Spectra can now be transformed to and from different data units
      (<I>Jy</I> to <I>W</I>/m<SUP>2</SUP>/<I>Hz</I> or 
<!-- MATH
 $erg/cm^{2}/s/Angstrom$
 -->
<I>erg</I>/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/<I>s</I>/Angstrom <I>etc.</I>).

<P>

<LI>The system look and feel is now the platform default. Mac OS X tweaks
      are enabled on that platform.

<P>

<LI>Data units are supported when editing and creating new spectra
     (polynomial and line fits).

<P>
