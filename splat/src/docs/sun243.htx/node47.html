<P>
All menus are now accessible using keyboard mnemonics. These are indicated by
an underlined character in the menu name. Pressing the &lt;Alt&gt; (platform
dependent) key followed by that character should post the menu. Some menu
items can be then activated by pressing a single character (again underlined)
or navigated to using the arrow keys.

<P>
Keyboard accelerators have also been assigned to some more useful menu
items. These can be activated by pressing the &lt;Control&gt; key and the designated
character, when the keyboard focus is in the associated window of the menu
item. The accelerator of an item is written next to the item in the menu.

<P>
Some one character accelerators have been assigned to plot actions. For
instance you can now hide any overlay graphics by pressing the `h' key, zoom
in X by pressing the `=' key etc. Consult the plot help menu for more about
these bindings.

<P>
Other changes in this release.

<P>

<UL><LI>When defining ranges (for fitting backgrounds and spectral lines) the
associated plot window is now brought forward and the cursor is changed.
Ranges can now be created without any graphical interaction (under these
circumstances the a range is initially created that covers the range between
the current axes).

<P>

<LI>An integrated flux option has been added to the statistics toolbox.
This can be used to estimate the flux in line of a background subtracted
spectrum.

<P>

<LI>Some useful UI defaults in the filter toolbox are now saved between
sessions.

<LI>New controls for replacing the currently displayed spectrum with
the result spectrum have been added to the polynomial, filter and interpolate 
toolboxes.

<P>

<LI>The order of the polynomial is now saved as a UI default.

<P>

<LI>A new filter that rebins a spectrum to reduce its resolution has been
added.

<P>

<LI>NDF/NDX spectra can now also be saved to NDF using NDX support. This is
useful on platforms that do not have native NDF support.

<LI>When fitting spectral lines of spectra whose coordinate systems run
high to low, rather than low to high, the widths etc. are now correctly
reported as positive values.

<P>

<LI>When deleting spectra in the global list the selection now remains
set at the next spectrum in the list (rather than selecting the
first spectrum).

<P>

<LI>A bug when reading text files that use whitespace column separators,
other than simple spaces, has been fixed and the previous behaviour
should be restored.

<P>

<LI>The set of automatically chosen colours are now dimmed slightly so that
they are always distinguishable from overlay graphics elements.

<P>

<LI>The percentile autocut now just applies to the data within the X 
range, when the X range is not being autoranged. When autoranged it
applies to all the data.

<P>

<LI>An integrated flux option has been added to the statistics toolbox.
This can be used to estimate the flux in line of a background subtracted
spectrum.

<P>

<LI>The use of file type "guessing" has been extended beyond the
<B>File-&gt;Browse</B> dialogue. This can now be selected from the
command-line, or from the  
<B>File-&gt;Open</B> dialogue. Guessing requires that the spectrum be opened
for each candidate type, so is intrinsically slower than file extension based 
typing. Remote resources will, in general, be opened using guessing.

<P>
<I>SPLAT-VO</I> has also been extended so that it can now interoperate with 
other VO-enabled desktop tools using the PLASTIC protocol.
