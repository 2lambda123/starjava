Flip or shift or redshift a spectrum</A>
</H2>

<P>
This window allows you to do three related jobs.

<UL><LI>Create and optionally flip a copy of the current spectrum.

<LI>Shift an editable spectrum.

<LI>Redshift an editable spectrum.

</UL>

<P>
Flipping and shifting a spectrum allows you to assess the symmetry of a
line. Shifting alone to determine how well spectra are aligned and redshifting
to transform a spectrum or set of line identifiers to guess or confirm the
redshift (all line identifier lists are already editable).

<P>
The transformation is applied to the spectrum shown in the
<B>Spectrum:</B> drop-down menu. Initially this will show any editable
spectra displayed in the associated plot (like the line identifiers).
If you want an editable copy of the current spectrum just press the
<B>Copy</B> button.

<P>
One subtlety is that the offset value is either a redshift or a value in the
coordinate units of the spectrum being modified, depending on whether the
<B>Redshift</B> checkbox is selected, or not. The coordinate units of
the spectrum may not be the same as those of the current spectrum in the plot,
which can lead to surprising results.

<P>
When applying a redshift it is assumed that the spectrum being modified has a
wavelength coordinate system, of some kind, unless it has a proper coordinate
system defined. In this latter case the only restriction is that you cannot
have a standard of rest set to `Source' (as a transformation to and from
Source is used to determine the redshift transform). In this latter case use
the coordinate system toolbox to transform to another rest frame first.

<P>
The <B>Reset</B> button returns a spectrum to an offset of zero.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Visitor lists</FONT></B>

<P>
It's often the case that you have a list of lines, in a spectrum, or many
spectra, that you'd like to step through to check the radial velocity or
redshift estimates, without the bother of reading each spectrum and line,
positioning the plot <I>etc.</I> That's what a visitor list is designed for.

<P>
To use this create a simple text file containing either one, two, three
or more whitespace separated columns. If one column is present then that is
assumed to be the wavelength of the lines. If two columns are present then
these are the wavelength and an associated spectrum. If three or more columns
are present then the third columns contains the name of the associated
spectrum and the second a label to be displayed at the position (when the
label is missing it is set to the wavelength). Very short examples of the
three types follow:

<P>
Visitor lists are a type of line identifier spectrum, so can have fully
specified spectral coordinate units written in a header section (see the line
identifier lists in the SPLAT distribution themselves for details), so you are
not restricted to having all your spectra in the same coordinate systems.

<P>
Once the visitor list is loaded <B>File-&gt;Read visitor line list</B>,
you can start stepping through it using the <B>Visitor</B> controls, or
jump to a particular line using the drop-down menu. The default behaviour of
this tool, on each visit, is to create a copy of the current spectrum and then
flip it centred on the line (the current zoom is also preserved). It you'd
like to not create a copy of the spectrum for each visit, or indeed to flip
it, then uncheck the <B>Flip</B> checkbox and select the menu item
<B>Options-&gt;One spectrum for visitor</B> (these choices remain enforced
between sessions).

<P>
Another way to use the visitor controls is to use a line identifier (either a
built in one, or one of your own) as the visitor list. To do this load the
line identifiers in the usual way (in the main window) and display them in the
plot. You can then make this the visitor list by pressing
<B>Set as visitor list</B>. Now using the visitor controls you can step
between the lines (remember to de-select <B>Flip</B> and select
<B>Options-&gt;One spectrum for visitor</B>, otherwise you'll get the line
identifiers copied, flipped and maybe reused!).

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">SPEFO options</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The original motivation for creating this tool (suggested by Petr Skoda, see
the acknowledgements section) was really to do flip comparisons of lines to
determine radial velocities in the same fashion as the SPEFO program. This has
some additional requirements beyond those required for simple shifting in a
linear sense, as well as in redshift, and are enabled by selecting the
<B>Options-&gt;SPEFO options</B> menu item. This reveals two text areas
(you need to resize the window to actually see them first time). The upper one
shows the flip corrected offset (that's half the standard shift) and the
radial velocity for that flipped shift
(calculated as 
<!-- MATH
 $c*Offset*0.5/(Flip centre)$
 -->
<I>c</I>*Offset*0.5/(<I>Flip centre</I>)), 
assuming that the coordinate system is some wavelength.

<P>
There's also an editable area for writing some notes about the measurement,
both these areas are written the file <TT>SPEFO.log</TT> by pressing the
<B>Save to SPEFO.log file</B> button.
