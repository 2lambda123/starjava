A plot window
</H2>

<P>
The anatomy of a plot window is shown below:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="502" HEIGHT="358" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="plot3.gif"
 ALT="905">
 
</DIV>

<P>
It has three main regions, the menubar &amp; toolbar, the control panel and
the display area.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">The display area</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The display area shows a view of all the spectra that are currently
 associated with this plot. The colours, plotting style <I>etc.</I> of these
 spectra are determined by their global properties as set in the main
 browser window.

<P>
The plot title and axis labels are determined using the properties of the
 current spectrum, if possible. For instance if the current spectrum is an NDF
 then these values are determined from the NDF's title, units and axis
 components, or for more recent NDFs from the properties of its WCS
 component. Similarly for FITS files these values are determined using the
 world coordinates FITS keywords. To change these look in the
 <B>Configure Plot Options</B> window, which is activated by pressing the
 <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="config.gif"
 ALT="911"> button.

<P>
The size of the area used to display a spectrum is initially determined from
 an automatic match of its data and coordinate extents to the visible surface
 of the display area, you can change the size of the display surface using the
 zoom controls described below and/or you can change the actual data limits
 using the <B>Configure Plot Options</B> window. When you add or remove a
 spectrum the apparent size of the display region stays the same and all the
 spectra now displayed are scaled to fit within it. To return to a state where
 the visible surface matches the display area you need to press the
 <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="fitwidth.gif"
 ALT="913"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="fitheight.gif"
 ALT="914"> buttons.

<P>
The <B>Configure Plot Options</B> window also offers the ability change
 the colour of the display area background, to draw the lines using
 anti-aliasing (which reduces the jagged effects, but at the cost of drawing
 speed), to modify the reserved area around the plot and do things like
 position the numeric labels, set the axis gaps <I>etc.</I> 
<P>
The following interactions are provided in the display area.

<UL><LI>Continuous coordinate and data readout: when you move the mouse
  pointer over the display area the coordinates and data value of the nearest
  point of the current spectrum are shown in the control panel.  If the
  readout is not updating you have probably moved outside of the extent of the
  current spectrum (the one selected in the <B>Displaying:</B> control).

<P>
If the vertical hair is enabled, then this also follows the mouse
  pointer.

<P>

<LI>Region Zoom: you can zoom on a feature by dragging a rectangle
  over it using the middle mouse button.

<P>

<LI>Incremental Zoom: you can increase the zoom factors by one
  simply by pressing the middle mouse button anywhere in the display
  area or pressing the <IMG
 WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$\_/=$">
keys. If you hold down the shift key
  these zoom in Y, otherwise in X.

<P>

<LI>Scrollbars: when the X or Y zooms make the plot greater in size
  than the display area scrollbars appear to the bottom and right. Just
  drag the sliders to scroll.

<P>

<LI>Keyboard Scroll: the arrows keys can be made to control the
  scroll, provided the keyboard focus is in the display area. Make sure
  of this by clicking the left mouse button while pointed in the display
  area.

<P>

<LI>Interpolated data value: if the keyboard focus is in the
  display area and the vertical hair is shown, then pressing the space
  bar will display the interpolated position of the hair, rather than
  the X coordinate and data value of the nearest position in the
  spectrum.

<P>

<LI>Interactive graphics control: if any interactive graphics figures are
  shown (such as those that define ranges for fitting backgrounds and spectral
  lines, or are produced by the controls in the <B>Graphics</B> menu),
  then these can be moved by selecting them (just click on one and little
  grips appear around the edges) and then dragging them and resized by
  dragging the edge grips.

<P>

<LI>Drop target: you can drop any spectra dragged from the global
  list and they will be displayed.

<P>

</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">The control panel</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The control panel area provides controls for interacting with the
 plot. It also shows details of what spectra are displayed in the plot
 and a continuous readout of the X coordinate and corresponding data
 value.

<P>
The <B>Displaying:</B> drop down list shows the names and current
 rendering properties of any spectra that are displayed. If you choose a
 spectrum from this list it becomes the <B>current spectrum</B> and is
 used as the basis for the plot's coordinates (so the readouts now show the
 values of this spectrum, also the plot will be re-drawn if the coordinate
 system of the newly selected spectrum is different). The selected spectrum
 also becomes selected in the browser window (so you see its details more
 clearly and apply modifications). This spectrum is also the one used by any
 tools (such as background and line fitting) that work with only one
 spectrum. If you remove this spectrum using the <B>Edit-&gt;Remove
 current spectrum</B> option then the next spectrum in the list becomes the
 current one.

<P>
The <B>Y limits (%):</B> drop down list provides a series of
 quick cuts for setting the limits of the Y axis. Normally this is the
 full range, but using a percentage cut can usefully clip the range to
 reject extreme outlier data values. The data values used are restricted
 to the limits of then X coordinates (all when automatic ranging is used, 
 the default ).

<P>
The <B>Wavelength:</B> entry control has two functions. The
 first is to show the current wavelength. The second is to allow you
 to centre the display area on a specific coordinate. Just type in the
 value you want to see here and press <TT>&lt;Return&gt;</TT>. Note that the
 label of this area modifies to match the label of the X axis, so
 could say something different to <B>Wavelength:</B>.

<P>
The <B>:V-hair</B> checkbox controls whether the `vertical hair'
 is shown. The vertical hair is just a vertical line that follows the
 mouse pointer around the display area. It can be quite slow, so isn't
 shown by default.

<P>
The <B>X scale:</B> and <B>Y scale:</B> controls change the
 zoom of the display area. The plus and minus controls increase and
 decrease the zoom by one, or you can choose a zoom from the drop-down
 lists, or you can type in a decimal value (which should be greater
 than equal to one) and press <TT>&lt;Return&gt;</TT>.

<P>
The <B>:log</B> controls determine if either of the axes are drawing
 using log spacing (this is not possible if either axis spans the value
 zero). Finer control of the log spacing and labelling can obtained using the
 plot configuration window.

<P>
The <B>Track free</B> checkbox determines what values are shown in the
 continuous coordinate readouts. When unchecked (the default) the values
 shown are the nearest ones of the current spectrum to the pointer position.
 When checked the readouts show the coordinates under the pointer.

<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Toolbar and menus</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The toolbar region has a series of buttons that act as short-cuts to
 most of the functions found in the main menus. Some of these create
 new windows with complex actions that should be consulted for further
 help.

<DD>Print a copy of the display area to an installed
  printer or to a file. The output produced fits the output page format using
  the current aspect ratio of the display area, so if you're zoomed by a large
  factor then you'll get an output page that has a very small height. If you
  want a printout of just the visible part then cut it out and display it in a
  new plot first. Postscript output from this dialogue isn't encapsulated.
  The next figure is an example of this output. Note that if you're looking at
  a paper copy of this document you're looking at the postscript output and if
  you're looking at the on-line help it shows a scaled JPEG for on-line copies

The <B>Options</B> menu contains several control items whose values are
 preserved between invocations of <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.

<P>

<UL><LI><B>Options-&gt;Match coordinates and/or fluxes</B>.
  When this is selected the plot will attempt to convert the spectral
  coordinates and fluxes of all displayed spectra into the systems of the
  current spectrum, so that they will be aligned when displayed.

<P>
Whether this works or not depends on whether the spectra that you have read
  in contain correct descriptions (or descriptions that <I>SPLAT-VO</I> can make good
  guesses about) of the spectral coordinates and data fluxes and whether the
  flux system is supported. If this doesn't work then check that your spectra
  have valid descriptions using the toolboxes in the main browser window for
  inspecting and setting spectral coordinates and data units
  (<IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="xunits.gif"
 ALT="963"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="yunits.gif"
 ALT="964">).

<P>
In the case of line identifier catalogues, these will also be transformed to
  the rest frame of the observed source (<I>i.e.</I> they will be red or blue shifted
  if you have defined the source velocity as part of its coordinate system
  definition).

<P>
Many spectra will not have appropriate coordinates or data units defined, so
  by default this option is switched off.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Match non-flux data units</B>.
  If your data units are not understood as fluxes it may still be possible to
  align them (dimensionally obvious unit conversions are possible for instance
  mK and K will be aligned correctly, as will eV and keV).

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Only display grid axes in visible area</B>
  Normally the labelled axes displaying the spectral and data coordinates are
  drawn to the full size of the display surface of the plot. This is the
  quickest mode as it reduces the need for re-drawing. If you select this
  option the axes will be only drawn within the the visible part of the plot,
  which makes it easier to see the coordinate labels, but means that the axes
  need to be re-drawn continually when scrolling.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Only display spectra within axes</B>
  Select this option if you only want spectra (including line identifiers) to
  be drawn within the bounds of the axes. When combined with the previous
  option to only display axes in the visible area this will potentially slow
  down scroll operations a lot, so the default is off.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Line identifiers-&gt;Load all matching line identifiers</B>
  If you select this option then all line identifiers known to <I>SPLAT-VO</I>   (including any that you have opened yourself), and whose coordinate ranges
  fall within that of the plot, will be loaded into the global list and
  displayed in the plot. Note that this will not work if the spectra displayed
  in the plot do not have defined spectral coordinates.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Line identifiers-&gt;Load all matching pre-loaded line identifiers</B>
  If you select this option then all line identifiers already loaded into the
  global list, and whose coordinate ranges fall within that of the plot, will
  be displayed in the plot. Note that this will not work if the spectra
  displayed in the plot do not have defined spectral coordinates.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Line identifiers-&gt;Positions track current spectrum</B>
  If you select this option then line identifiers that do not have data
  positions (this is typically true) will be positioned above the current
  spectrum, rather than displayed in a line along the bottom of the plot.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Line identifiers-&gt;Prefix name to labels</B>
  If you select this item then the short name of each line identifier spectrum
  displayed in the plot will be prefixed to the label. This allows you to
  discriminate between crowded labels. Note that the short name of a line
  identifier can be modified in the main window, once it is loaded into the
  global list.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Line identifiers-&gt;Draw horizontal labels</B>
  Select this option if you want line identifier labels drawn horizontally
  rather than vertically.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Error bar auto-ranging</B>. When auto-ranging a
  spectrum that has associated errors the limits do not include the extent of
  any error bars that will be drawn, if you want this to be otherwise select
  this option.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Auto-fit percentiles in Y</B>. When this option is
  selected choosing a percentile limit in Y results in the plot also being
  forced to fit the height of the plot.

<P>

<LI><B>Options-&gt;Short names in menu lists</B>. When this option is
  deselected the long names (usually file names) are shown in the
  <A NAME="Displaying:"></A> drop-down menu.

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">The Graphics menu</FONT></B>

<P>
The <B>Graphics</B> menu provides methods for drawing text and a range of
figures on the plot. This allows you to add annotations, but also provides the
basis for the interactive graphics used by the various toolboxes.

<P>
To draw a figure on a plot you need to select an option from the
<B>Drawing mode</B> sub-menu and then, depending on the figure type, either
drag out a region or select fiducial points. When creating a figure using
points these are completed using a double click on the last point.

Interpolated curves are like polylines in that they are defined by a series of
points, but they can only have increasing or decreasing X coordinates (so
cannot double back on themselves). They are intended for drawing figures that
are related to spectra, specifically spectral backgrounds and lines. In fact
if you draw an interpolated curve you can convert it into a spectrum for
removing from a real spectrum using the <B>Generate spectra from
interpolated lines</B> toolbox. The types of interpolation scheme available are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL><LI>Hermite, interpolation based on Hermite polynomials. The effect is
        supposed to construct reasonable analytic curves through discrete data
        points (<I>i.e.</I> like those a human would produce).

<P>

<LI>Akima, interpolation based on Akima splines. Like Hermite this
        supposed to construct human-like analytic curves.

<P>

<LI>Cubic, interpolation using natural cubic splines.

<P>

<LI>Polynomial, interpolation using a simple polynomial of order one less
        than the current number of points.

<P>

<LI>Linear, interpolation using straight-lines (like polyline, except it
        has sorted X coordinates).

<P>

<LI>Gaussian, interpolation using a Gaussian line-profile. This can only
        have four reference positions (and is initialised from the first two
        indicated on the plot), these define the left extent, width,
        height/centre and right extent. The order will switch if these are
        dragged past each other (so dragging the width grip beyond the left
        extent grip will switch their meaning).

<P>

<LI>Lorentz, interpolation using a Lorentzian line-profile. Works like the
        Gaussian curve.

<P>

<LI>Voigt, interpolation using a Voigt line-profile. This also works like
        the Gaussian curve, but has five characteristic positions, left
