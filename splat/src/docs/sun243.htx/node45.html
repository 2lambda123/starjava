Tool interoperability using PLASTIC
</H1>

<P>
<I>SPLAT-VO</I> can communicate with other desktop tools, for instance
exchanging spectra with them, using a protocol called PLASTIC.
These functions are controlled from the <B>Interop</B> menu
in the browser window, which looks like this:

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">What is PLASTIC?</FONT></B>

<P>
PLASTIC stands for the PLatform for AStronomical Tool InterConnection.
It is a protocol which allows tools on the desktop to communicate
with each other.  Briefly, the way it works is that applications
can send messages to a central <EM>hub process</EM> which will
then pass them on to other applications which can respond to them
in some appropriate way.  
The messages are things like ``load this spectrum''.
Applications which currently talk PLASTIC include
TOPCAT, GAIA and various tools from the AstroGrid project.

<P>
You can find more information about how it works, what applications
are compatible, and how it can be useful at the
<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="http://plastic.sourceforge.net/">PLASTIC web site</A>.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">How do I use PLASTIC with <I>SPLAT-VO</I>?</FONT></B>

<P>
In order for PLASTIC communications to work, a PLASTIC hub must be
running on your machine.  It is generally best to start this 
outside of <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.  The recommended way to do this is
currently to run the <B>AstroGrid Workbench</B>,
which can be started using Java WebStart by following links on the
<A NAME="tex2html7"
 HREF="http://software.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid web site</A>.
It is possible however to start the hub using either the
<B>Start internal PLASTIC hub</B> or <B>Start external PLASTIC hub</B>
menu items.  The internal one will terminate when you exit <I>SPLAT-VO</I>,
but the external one will continue running until it is explicitly stopped.

<P>
If the hub is running when <I>SPLAT-VO</I> starts up, <I>SPLAT-VO</I> will connect to it
(``register'') automatically.
If you start the hub while <I>SPLAT-VO</I> is already running,
you can connect to it by selecting the <B>Register with PLASTIC</B>
option from the <B>Interop</B> menu.  When registered,
<I>SPLAT-VO</I> will listen out for messages from other applications and act
on them.  You will also be able to send messages to other applications.
If you want to stop <I>SPLAT-VO</I> responding to any such messages,
you can select <B>Unregister with PLASTIC</B> from the same menu.

<P>
The <B>Show Registered Applications</B> menu item will display a
little window that gives the names of applications currently registered.
This will show you which other tools are in a position to send messages
to or receive them from <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">What PLASTIC facilities does <I>SPLAT-VO</I> support?</FONT></B>

<P>
Currently, <I>SPLAT-VO</I>'s PLASTIC interaction is confined to receiving
spectra from, and sending spectra to, other applications.

<P>
Normally, if another PLASTIC application sends spectral data to <I>SPLAT-VO</I>,
it will respond by attempting to add it to the global list
just as if you had loaded it in the usual way.
This is usually what you want to happen, but two checkbox items
are provided on the <B>Interop</B> menu which allow you to turn this 
behaviour off: <B>Accept spectra</B> and <B>Accept 1d FITS</B>.
If you uncheck these, then incoming requests to load
spectral data or 1-dimensional FITS files respectively will be ignored.

<P>
You can also perform the opposite trick, take a spectrum which is
displayed in <I>SPLAT-VO</I> and send it to one or all of the other tools
currently registered with PLASTIC.  To do this select one of the
<B>Broadcast spectrum</B> or <B>Send spectrum to ...</B> items.  
The Broadcast action sends the data to all listening tools.
The Send action sends only to a single selected tool; you choose it
from the submenu to the right.  Only tools which (claim they) know 
what to do with spectral data will be listed; if none of the 
currently-registered tools is prepared to accept data in that format, 
the Send options will be unavailable.
