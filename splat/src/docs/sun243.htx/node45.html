Tool interoperability using PLASTIC
</H1>

<P>
<I>SPLAT-VO</I> can communicate with other desktop tools, for instance
exchanging spectra with them, using a protocol called PLASTIC.
These functions are controlled from the <B>Interop</B> menu
in the browser window, which looks like this:

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">What is PLASTIC?</FONT></B>

<P>
PLASTIC stands for the PLatform for AStronomical Tool InterConnection.
It is a protocol which allows tools on the desktop to communicate
with each other.  Briefly, the way it works is that applications
can send messages to a central <EM>hub process</EM> which will
then pass them on to other applications which can respond to them
in some appropriate way.  
The messages are things like ``load this spectrum''.
Applications which currently talk PLASTIC include
TOPCAT, GAIA and various tools from the AstroGrid project.

<P>
You can find more information about how it works, what applications
are compatible, and how it can be useful at the
<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="http://plastic.sourceforge.net/">PLASTIC web site</A>.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">How do I use PLASTIC with <I>SPLAT-VO</I>?</FONT></B>

<P>
In order for PLASTIC communications to work, a PLASTIC hub must be
running on your machine.  It is generally best to start this 
outside of <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.  The recommended way to do this is
currently to run the <B>AstroGrid Workbench</B>,
which can be started using Java WebStart by following links on the
<A NAME="tex2html7"
 HREF="http://software.astrogrid.org/">AstroGrid web site</A>.
It is possible however to start the hub using either the
<B>Start internal PLASTIC hub</B> or <B>Start external PLASTIC hub</B>
menu items.  The internal one will terminate when you exit <I>SPLAT-VO</I>,
but the external one will continue running until it is explicitly stopped.

<P>
If the hub is running when <I>SPLAT-VO</I> starts up, <I>SPLAT-VO</I> will connect to it
(``register'') automatically.
If you start the hub while <I>SPLAT-VO</I> is already running,
you can connect to it by selecting the <B>Register with PLASTIC</B>
option from the <B>Interop</B> menu.  When registered,
<I>SPLAT-VO</I> will listen out for messages from other applications and act
on them.  You will also be able to send messages to other applications.
If you want to stop <I>SPLAT-VO</I> responding to any such messages,
you can select <B>Unregister with PLASTIC</B> from the same menu.

<P>
The <B>Show Registered Applications</B> menu item will display a
little window that gives the names of applications currently registered.
This will show you which other tools are in a position to send messages
to or receive them from <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">What PLASTIC facilities does <I>SPLAT-VO</I> support?</FONT></B>

<P>
Currently, <I>SPLAT-VO</I>'s PLASTIC interaction is confined to receiving
spectra from, and sending spectra to, other applications.

<P>
The <B>Interop</B> menu has various <B>Accept spectra as ...</B>
checkboxes (some of these are set by default and some not).
The ones which are set indicate that <I>SPLAT-VO</I> is listening out for
messages from other applications which want to send data in that format.
If another tool sends data in that format to <I>SPLAT-VO</I> or to all
listening applications, then <I>SPLAT-VO</I> will attempt to load it as
a spectrum and add it to the global list just as if you had 
loaded it in the normal way.

<P>
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that data sent in this way by other
tools actually represent a spectrum, so it is not always wise to 
accept these things - for instance a VOTable being sent by another
tool may represent a source catalogue rather than a spectrum,
in which case attempting to display it as a spectrum wouldn't be very 
useful.  These Load messages will normally arrive through the
PLASTIC system only if you, the user, take some action to send them
(e.g. click a ``Send table'' button in a different tool), so you
shouldn't have to worry about receiving them from out of the blue, 
but it is sometimes helpful to filter the ones which arrive
using these checkboxes.

<P>
You can also perform the opposite trick, take a spectrum which is
displayed in <I>SPLAT-VO</I> and send it to one or all of the other tools
currently registered with PLASTIC.  To do this select one of the
<B>Broadcast spectrum as ...</B> or <B>Send spectrum as ...</B>
items.  
The Broadcast actions send the data to all listening tools.
The Send actions send only to a single selected one; you choose it
from the submenu to the right.  Only tools which know what to do
with that kind of data will be listed; if none of the currently-registered
tools is prepared to accept data in that format, the Send options
will be unavailable.
