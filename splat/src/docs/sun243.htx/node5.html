Displaying more than one spectrum
</H2>

<P>
Displaying many spectra at the same time isn't much more difficult
than the single spectrum case. Just open up several spectra by giving
their names on the command-line, or by opening them using the
<B>File-&gt;Open</B> dialogue. This will produce a main window that
looks something like:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="454" HEIGHT="360" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="browser3.gif"
 ALT="403">
 
</DIV>

<P>
If you've opened all the spectra at once (you can do this using the
<B>File-&gt;Open</B> dialogue by selecting more than one file -
just hold down the shift key while selecting each one) then they will
have also all appeared displayed in a single plot, which should look
something like:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="502" HEIGHT="358" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="plot2.gif"
 ALT="407">
 
</DIV>

<P>
Again you should now close the plot (or all the plots if you've opened
the spectra one-by-one) so you can find out how to add spectra to
plots manually.

<P>
There are three ways to display a set of spectra in a single plot, you
can either open a plot just displaying one spectrum and then add the
others one-by-one, by two different methods, or you can open a plot
displaying a pre-selected list of spectra. Let's cover the latter
option first.

<P>
<A NAME="selecting_spectra"></A>The first thing to do is identify which spectra you want to display in
the same plot, you do this by selecting their names in the
<B>Global list of spectra:</B> list. You can select more than one
name at a time by holding down the control key, while clicking on the
name. It's also possible to select ranges of names by selecting the
first name and then selecting the last name while holding down the
shift key. Have a play to see the effects that you can get with
combinations of these (hint: using the control key also allows you to
remove single names from the selection). To select all the names you
can also use the <B>Edit-&gt;Select all spectra</B> menu item.

<P>
Now that you've selected the spectra to display, just press the
multi-display button: <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="multidisplay.gif"
 ALT="411"> and all the spectra
will be displayed in a single plot. Note that if you inadvertently
press the single display button: <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="display.gif"
 ALT="412">, then each
spectrum will appear in a plot of it's own (this can be a very bad
idea if you have a very large number of spectra selected!).

<P>
If you don't like the colours chosen for your spectra you can just press the
auto-colour button: <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="rainbow.gif"
 ALT="413"> to get a new set. Each press of this
button should generate a new set of colours, so just keep clicking until you
see a combination that you like.

<P>
The second method for adding more than one spectrum to a plot is the
simplest, you can drag spectra from the <B>Global list of
spectra:</B> and drop them into the display area of the plot. To drag a
single spectrum just make sure that it is selected and then attempt to
drag it from the <B>Global list of spectra:</B> into the plot
(during dragging a document icon should be attached to your screen
pointer). To drag more than one you just need to make all the spectra
you want displayed selected and then attempt to drag any of the
selected set.

<P>
The third method is actually also the method you'd use to remove a
spectrum from a plot. The first thing to do is select a spectrum in the
<B>Global list of spectra:</B>,
this shows its properties in the
<B>Properties of current spectra:</B>
side of the browser window, including which views
are being made (<I>i.e.</I> which plots are displaying it). To add or remove
a spectrum from a plot you need to click on the square shown in the
<B>Displayed</B> column, so that it becomes ticked or unticked. See
in the following image that <TT>test spectrum 2</TT> is currently
being displayed in <TT>&lt;plot0&gt;</TT>:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="454" HEIGHT="360" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="browser4.gif"
 ALT="423">
 
</DIV>

<P>
If any spectra were not displayed in this plot then they could be
added to it using this mechanism. Naturally this also extends to the
case when there are many plots available.
