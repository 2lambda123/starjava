Displaying a spectrum</A>
</H2>

<P>
To start <I>SPLAT</I> you should just need to type the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
 % splat &amp;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This assumes that you have <I>SPLAT</I> installed on your system as part of a
standard Starlink installation. If not then you'll need follow any
installation and pre-startup instructions that you have before using
this command.

<P>
When <I>SPLAT</I> appears it should look something like:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="308" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="browser1.gif"
 ALT="330">
 
</DIV>

<P>
This is the main <TT>browser</TT> window. It has a list containing all
the available spectra (in what we call the `global list', but has been
traditionally referred to as the `stack'). Using this window you can
add, save and remove spectra from the list, you can change how a
spectrum draws itself, in all the places that it is shown and make a
spectrum add itself to a plot - this is how you view spectra.

<P>
You can also do things like change the look and feel of the whole
application (there are different colour and font schemes), perform
some quite primitive mathematical operations on or between the
spectra, run through an animated display sequence of some or all of the
spectra, set the spectra coordinate systems and modify/inspect their
values. So things that apply to each spectrum, wherever it is shown,
or the program as a whole are generally done in this window.

<P>
To open your first spectrum select the <B>Open</B> item in the
<B>File</B> menu. This will create a familiar open file dialog
window. Just navigate to your spectrum, select it, and press
<B>Open</B> to proceed.

<P>
Alternatively you could have supplied the spectrum you want to use on
the command-line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
 % splat &lt;spectrum_file&gt; &amp;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Which will read the spectrum stored in the named file. <I>SPLAT</I> will read
spectra stored in NDF, FITS and TEXT files, as well as NDX format.

<P>
Now that you've actually read in a spectrum it will be immediately
displayed in a `plot'. Have a look at this plot window briefly, if you
want, but close it before proceeding (to close it select the
<B>Close</B> item in its <B>File</B> menu). You really need to
understand how to display a spectrum in a plot yourself, if you're to
gain complete control over the creation of plots and what they
display.

<P>
The browser window (once again on its own) should now appear something
like:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="308" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="browser2.gif"
 ALT="340">
 
</DIV>

<P>
Now to re-create a plot and display a spectrum in it the hard
way. Actually this couldn't be simpler, just `double click' on the
name in the <B>Global list of spectra</B>. Another way to achieve
the same effect is to <TT>select</TT> the name (by just clicking on it
once, you can tell it's selected when it becomes highlighted, as shown
above) and choose the display selected spectra button in the
toolbar. This is the button that looks like <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="display.gif"
 ALT="344"> (it's
meant to represent a spectrum with axes drawn in a plot). If you're
successful then a window looking like this:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="461" HEIGHT="353" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="plot1.gif"
 ALT="346">
 
</DIV>

<P>
should appear as before.

<P>
Since <I>SPLAT</I> is meant to be capable of displaying many spectra
(sometimes in the same plot as we'll see in the next section), you
should confirm this by creating a second plot window, by just
performing the same operation again (<I>i.e.</I> double click on the
spectrum name).
