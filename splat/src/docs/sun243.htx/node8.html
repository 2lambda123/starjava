The browser window
</H2>

<P>
The browser window has several main elements, each of which is shown
in the following figure:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Global list of spectra</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In the <B>Global list of spectra</B> short names for each
 spectra are shown. The short names are intended to allow the quick
 identification of spectra and can be modified at any time by
 selecting the name and then typing a new name in the
 <B>Short name</B> field (remember to press <TT>&lt;Return&gt;</TT> to
 make the change happen). Initially short names are read from the
 <TT>TITLE</TT> or <TT>OBJECT</TT> properties of spectral data formats
 that support these (<I>i.e.</I> NDF and FITS respectively), otherwise they
 default to the file name.

<P>
Another important concept related to the global list, is using it to
 create a selected range or list of the spectra. Selection is
 important as this identifies which spectra you'd like to see
 properties for, or want to work with. There's a quick tutorial on
 <A HREF="node5.html#selecting_spectra">selecting spectra</A> in the introductory material
 .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Properties of current spectra</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In the properties area there are controls for changing how the currently
 selected spectra are displayed (a spectrum always uses the same display
 properties) and where they are displayed.

<P>
If more than one spectrum is selected then the properties shown are those of
 the first spectrum (<I>i.e.</I> highest in the global list). However, any changes
 that you then make are applied to all the selected spectra.

<P>
If you load a table into <I>SPLAT-VO</I> the <B>Columns:</B> controls will show
 the names of the columns selected. If these are incorrect then you can choose
 a different set.

<P>
The properties that you can change include the colour (press on this to get a
 swatch of selectable colours), the composite value (that is the transparency
 so you can see lines or points through other line or points), the line type
 (simple connected polyline or histogram, or just a point marker). If you
 choose to draw lines then you can set the width and style (dashed <I>etc.</I>). If
 you choose to draw points then various types are available.

<P>
If the selected spectra have errors then you can display error bars by
 clicking on the <B>Error bars:</B> control. This is greyed out if errors
 are not available. The colour, number of sigma drawn and frequency of the
 error bars can be changed using the other controls on this line.

<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Views of current spectra</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The views of the current spectra region shows the names of the plots that are
 displaying the currently selected spectra (this time if a plot is showing
 only some of the spectra, then it is highlighted in red). To add a spectrum
 or list of spectra to a plot, select their names in the global list and then
 click on the <B>Displayed</B> control (normally this results in a tick
 appearing). If a plot is already displaying some of the selected spectra then
 you force it to display them all by clicking twice - the first click removes
 the selected spectra and the second puts them all back, plus the ones not
 already shown.

<P>
To make a plot visible double click on its name. This should raise and
 deiconify it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Toolbar and menus</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The toolbar region has a series of buttons that act as short-cuts to
 many of the functions found in the main menus. Here's a quick break
 down of what they do:
 <DL COMPACT>
<DT><IMG
WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="openfile.gif"
 ALT="585">
<DD>Create an open file dialogue. You can use this
  to browse any local files and select a list of them for opening. When
  opened they are added to the global list and displayed in a new plot
  (unless you untick the <B>Display</B> control). You may open files
  that are already in the global list, this just creates a new entry.
  Normally the type of a spectrum is determined using the file extension,
  but using this dialogue you can select a type.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="location.gif"
 ALT="587">
<DD>Download and display a spectrum from the Internet.
  If you have a URL for a spectrum to view then use this simple dialog.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="ssap.gif"
 ALT="588">
<DD>Query any known Simple Spectral Access Protocol (SSAP)
  servers about spectra that they hold on a region of the sky and download
  these to <I>SPLAT-VO</I>. This tool provides access to the Virtual Observatory.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="browse.gif"
 ALT="590">
<DD>Browse a hierarchy of files. This dialogue can be used
  like the open file dialogue to choose a file containing a spectrum, but,
  it also allows you to look inside a file for any displayable components.
  This is useful for FITS files that contain extensions (spectral or table
  extensions can be opened), or HDS files that contain more than one NDF.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="391" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="treeview.gif"
 ALT="592">
 
</DIV>

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="reopen.gif"
 ALT="594">
<DD>Re-open the selected spectra. If the files containing
  your spectra change on disk you can select them in the global list get them
  opened. Note that not all spectra are backed by a suitable disk-file, these
  types will be ignored.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="savefile.gif"
 ALT="595">
<DD>Create a save file dialogue. Using this you can
  save a spectrum to disk-file. There are no restrictions on which file
  format you can save to, but information may be lost for certain types
  (<I>i.e.</I> TEXT format).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="remove.gif"
 ALT="597">
<DD>Remove the currently selected spectra from the
  global list. This does not modify disk files. Spectra that are only
  resident in memory will be lost, without warning.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="display.gif"
 ALT="598">
<DD>Display the currently selected spectra in
  plots. Each of the selected spectra is displayed in a plot of its
  own. A similar effect is obtained by double-clicking a spectrum in the
  global list.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="multidisplay.gif"
 ALT="599">
<DD>Display all the currently selected
  spectra in a single plot. Use this when you want to compare spectra.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="animate.gif"
 ALT="600">
<DD>Open a window to control the animation of some
  of the spectra. Using this window you can also create a JPEG sequence
  of the animation.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="table.gif"
 ALT="601">
<DD>View and possibly modify the coordinates and
  data values of the selected spectra. This shows an editable table of
  values. It is also possible to make global changes using
  algebraic expressions to convert or create new values.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="xunits.gif"
 ALT="602">
<DD>Open a window to set or remap the coordinate
  systems of any of the spectra. A variety of systems can be used
  covering wavelength, frequency, energy and velocity. Unit
  information can be used to align spectra in a plot (so you can
  trivially compare spectra in say angstroms and nanometres,
  energy and frequency or even heliocentric and topocentric rest frames
  <I>etc.</I>).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="yunits.gif"
 ALT="604">
<DD>Open a window to set the data units of any spectra.
  This can be useful when just setting the units displayed in a plot, but
  can also be used to convert spectra between flux systems when they are
  drawn (making them correctly aligned).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="rainbow.gif"
 ALT="605">
<DD>Change the colour of <TT>all</TT> the spectra
  in the global list. Each time you press this button a new random seed
  is used to generate a different sequence of colours, so keep pressing
  until you see a sequence you like.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="binarymath.gif"
 ALT="607">
<DD>Perform simple maths (add, subtract, divide
  and multiply) between pairs of spectra.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="unarymaths.gif"
 ALT="608">
<DD>Perform simple maths using a spectrum and a
  constant (add, subtract, divide and multiply).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="help.gif"
 ALT="609">
<DD>Access the on-line help system.

<P>
</DL>

<P>
Interesting menu items not found in the toolbar are a list of standard line
 position catalogues (for optical and some IR and submillimeter lines), these
 are found in <B>Options-&gt;Line identifiers</B>.  Others are to do with
 controlling the selection of the spectra and plots (see the <B>Edit</B>
 menu, just like deleting spectra from the global list you can delete all the
 selected plots) and changing the `look and feel' of <I>SPLAT-VO</I>. These options are
 found in the <B>Options-&gt;Look and Feel</B> and
 <B>Options-&gt;Colour Theme</B> sub-menus. Note that if you select the
 CDE/Motif look and feel you cannot change the colour and fonts used.

<P>
You can also save and restore the global stack of spectra to and from
 diskfile using a special data format that is only recognised by <I>SPLAT-VO</I>.
 Using this method allows you to save a working set of spectra and restart an
 analysis later. Properties such as the line colours are restored, but any
 relationship between disk files and the spectra in the global list is
 lost. Data saved in a stack are compressed.
