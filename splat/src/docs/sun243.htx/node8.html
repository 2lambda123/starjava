The browser window
</H2>

<P>
The browser window has several main elements, each of which is shown
in the following figure:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="489" HEIGHT="356" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="browser5.gif"

</DIV>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Global list of spectra</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In the <B>Global list of spectra</B> short names for each
 spectra are shown. The short names are intended to allow the quick
 identification of spectra and can be modified at any time by
 selecting the name and then typing a new name in the
 <B>Short name</B> field (remember to press <TT>&lt;Return&gt;</TT> to
 make the change happen). Initially short names are read from the
 <TT>TITLE</TT> or <TT>OBJECT</TT> properties of spectral data formats
 that support these (<I>i.e.</I> NDF and FITS respectively), otherwise they
 default to the file name.

<P>
Another important concept related to the global list, is using it to
 create a selected range or list of the spectra. Selection is
 important as this identifies which spectra you'd like to see
 properties for, or want to work with. There's a quick tutorial on
 <A HREF="node5.html#selecting_spectra">selecting spectra</A> in the introductory material
 .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Properties of current spectra</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 In the properties area there are controls for changing how the
 currently selected spectra are displayed (a spectrum always uses the
 same display properties) and where they are displayed.

<P>
If more than one spectrum is selected then the properties shown are
 those of the first spectrum (<I>i.e.</I> highest in the global
 list). However, any changes that you then make are applied to all the
 selected spectra.

<P>
If you load a table into <I>SPLAT</I> the <B>Columns:</B> controls
 will show the names of the columns selected. If these are incorrect
 then you can choose a different set.

<P>
If the selected spectra have errors then you can display error bars by
 clicking on the <B>Error bars:</B> control. This is greyed out if
 errors are not available.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Views of current spectra</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The views of the current spectra region shows the names of the plots
 that are displaying the currently selected spectra (this time if a
 plot is showing only some of the spectra, then it is highlighted in
 red). To add a spectrum or list of spectra to a plot, select their
 names in the global list and then click on the <B>Displayed</B>
 control (normally this results in a tick appearing). If a plot is
 already displaying some of the selected spectra then you force it to
 display them all by clicking twice - the first click removes the
 selected spectra and the second puts them all back, plus the ones not
 already shown.

<P>
To make a plot visible double click on its name. This should raise and
 deiconify it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Toolbar and menus</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The toolbar region has a series of buttons that act as short-cuts to
 many of the functions found in the main menus. Here's a quick break
 down of what they do:
 <DL COMPACT>
<DT><IMG
WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="openfile.gif"
 ALT="580">
<DD>Create an open file dialogue. You can use this
  to browse any local files and select a list of them for opening. When
  opened they are added to the global list and displayed in a new plot
  (unless you untick the <B>Display</B> control). You may open files
  that are already in the global list, this just creates a new entry.
  Normally the type of a spectrum is determined using the file extension,
  but using this dialogue you can select a type.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="browse.gif"
 ALT="582">
<DD>Browse a hierarchy of files. This dialogue can be used
  like the open file dialogue to choose a file containing a spectrum, but,
  it also allows you to look inside a file for any displayable components.
  This is useful for FITS files that contain extensions (spectral or table
  extensions can be opened), or HDS files that contain more than one NDF.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
 <IMG
 WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="391" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="treeview.gif"
 ALT="584">
 
</DIV>

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="reopen.gif"
 ALT="586">
<DD>Re-open the selected spectra. If the files containing
  your spectra change on disk you can select them in the global list get them
  opened. Note that not all spectra are backed by a suitable disk-file, these
  types will be ignored.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="savefile.gif"
 ALT="587">
<DD>Create a save file dialogue. Using this you can
  save a spectrum to disk-file. There are no restrictions on which file
  format you can save to, but information may be lost for certain types
  (<I>i.e.</I> TEXT format).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="readstack.gif"
 ALT="589">
<DD>Read a stack of previously saved spectra
  back from a disk-file. This is a special data format that is only
  recognised by <I>SPLAT</I>.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="savestack.gif"
 ALT="591">
<DD>Write a representation of the current
  spectra in the global list out to disk, <I>i.e.</I> save the stack. This can
  be re-read by using the read-stack item. Using this method allows you
  to save a working set of spectra and restart an analysis
  later. Properties such as the line colours are restored, but any
  relationship between disk files and the spectra in the global list is
  lost. This format is only for use with <I>SPLAT</I>. Data saved in a stack
  is compressed.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="remove.gif"
 ALT="594">
<DD>Remove the currently selected spectra from the
  global list. This does not modify disk files. Spectra that are only
  resident in memory will be lost, without warning.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="display.gif"
 ALT="595">
<DD>Display the currently selected spectra in
  plots. Each of the selected spectra is displayed in a plot of its
  own. A similar effect is obtained by double-clicking a spectrum in the
  global list.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="multidisplay.gif"
 ALT="596">
<DD>Display all the currently selected
  spectra in a single plot. Use this when you want to compare spectra.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="animate.gif"
 ALT="597">
<DD>Open a window to control the animation of some
  of the spectra. Using this window you can also create a JPEG sequence
  of the animation.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="table.gif"
 ALT="598">
<DD>View and possibly modify the coordinates and
  data values of the selected spectra. This shows an editable table of
  values. It is also possible to make global changes using
  algebraic expressions to convert or create new values.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="xunits.gif"
 ALT="599">
<DD>Open a window to set or remap the coordinate
  systems of any of the spectra. A variety of systems can be used
  covering wavelength, frequency, energy and velocity. Unit
  information can be used to align spectra in a plot (so you can
  trivially compare spectra in say angstroms and nanometres,
  energy and frequency or even heliocentric and topocentric rest frames
  <I>etc.</I>.).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="rainbow.gif"
 ALT="601">
<DD>Change the colour of <TT>all</TT> the spectra
  in the global list. Each time you press this button a new random seed
  is used to generate a different sequence of colours, so keep pressing
  until you see a sequence you like.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="binarymath.gif"
 ALT="603">
<DD>Perform simple maths (add, subtract, divide
  and multiply) between pairs of spectra.

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="unarymaths.gif"
 ALT="604">
<DD>Perform simple maths using a spectrum and a
  constant (add, subtract, divide and multiply).

<P>
<DT><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="CENTER"
 SRC="help.gif"
 ALT="605">
<DD>Access the on-line help system.

<P>
</DL>

<P>
Interesting menu items not found in the toolbar are a list of
 standard line position catalogues (for optical and some IR and
 submillimeter lines), these are found in
 <B>Options=&gt;Line identifiers</B>.
 Others are to do with controlling the selection of the spectra and
 plots (see the <B>Edit</B> menu, just like deleting spectra from
 the global list you can delete all the selected plots) and changing
 the `look and feel' of <I>SPLAT</I>. These options are found in the
  <B>Options=&gt;Look and Feel</B> and
 <B>Options=&gt;Colour Theme</B> sub-menus. Note that if you
 select the CDE/Motif look and feel you cannot change the colour and
 fonts used.
