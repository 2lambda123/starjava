Classes for using and implementing <tt>Ndx</tt> objects.
In order to use <tt>Ndx</tt>s, only the {@link Ndx} and {@link NdxAccess}
classes are required.
<p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
Use of exceptions is kept to a reasonable minimum for the Ndx class.
In general the policy is that if something serious fails, such as
an Ndx not being able to supply its Image array, a checked NdxException
will be thrown.  However if something minor fails, such as an Ndx
not being able to supply its title, a sensible value (such as <tt>null</tt>)
is returned and a message is logged through the <tt>uk.ac.starlink.ndx</tt>
logger.
