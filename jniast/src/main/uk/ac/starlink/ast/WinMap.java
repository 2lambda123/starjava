/**
 * Java interface to the AST WinMap class
 *  - map one window on to another by scaling and shifting each axis. 
 * A Winmap is a linear Mapping which transforms a rectangular
 * window in one coordinate system into a similar window in another
 * coordinate system by scaling and shifting each axis (the window
 * edges being parallel to the coordinate axes).
 * <p>
 * A WinMap is specified by giving the coordinates of two opposite
 * corners (A and B) of the window in both the input and output
 * coordinate systems.
