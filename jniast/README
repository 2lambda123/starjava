This is the JNI wrapper for the Starlink AST library.
Its version numbers track the version numbers of AST (for versions >1.4);
thus JNIAST V1.8-13 must be built against AST V1.8-13 or higher.
If it is not, the build may go ahead OK but the test should fail.

Set the ADDLIBS environment variable to the location of the correct
version of the AST library during build if it is not in the usual place.

Partial change log:

14-MAR-2003:
   Version 1.8-13:
      The new version replaces v1.3 (which corresponded to AST V1.8-8).

      New features relating to changes in AST between 1.8-8 and 1.8-13:
         Frame:
            new attributes Top(axis), Bottom(axis)
         WcsMap:
            new constants AST__TPN, AST__SZP
         FitsChan:
            new attributes DefB1950, CarLin
         Plot:
            new graphical elements Axis1, Axis2, Grid1, Grid2,
                                   NumLabs1, NumLabs2, TextLab1, TextLab2,
                                   Ticks1, Ticks2
            new attribute Invisible
            new method boundingBox

      Fixed a bug in javadoc formatting of graphical elements in Plot.

      Modified Plot constructors to take Rectangle2D objects not Rectangles
         (which might be necessary for non-pixel-like Grf implementations).
         Shouldn't result in any backward incompatibility since
         Rectangle is a subclass of Rectangle2D.

      Fixed a bug in the Plot Font attribute - it was a String but is now
         an int as it should be.  This is a backwardly incompatible change.

      Attempted to report when the JNIAST and AST versions are not matching.
         Doesn't work perfectly however since it is hard to ineterrogate
         the AST library at runtime about its version.
