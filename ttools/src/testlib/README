Contains jar files for JING, which does XML Schema validation.
These are required only for unit testing of the auto-generated
CEA app-description file.

See http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html for info on Jing.

Note this probably isn't a particularly sensible way to do it - 
most of Jing is concerned with Relax-NG validation (I think) but it
does work.  J2SE1.5 contains schema validation facilities in the
javax.xml.validation package, so if we go to 1.5 for the build/test,
this can probably be eliminated.
