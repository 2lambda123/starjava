<em>Pan.</em>
    In the Sin projection, this attempts to rotate the sphere, 
    with north staying vertical on the screen, in such a way that the
    same part of the sky stays under the cursor position.
    At low magnifications this is sometimes not possible;
    if the mouse starts on the sphere and ends up off it the navigation
    will be jerky.
    
    <p>The Aitoff and Plate Car&eacute;e projections act like a piece of
    paper that can be dragged around in two dimensions in the usual way.

<em>Zoom.</em>
    Spinning the mouse wheel forwards/backwards will zoom in/out around
    the mouse position.  For this Sin projection this will also have the
    effect of rotating the sphere to keep North vertical on the screen.

<em>Stretch zoom.</em>
    Dragging with the right mouse button up-and-right/down-and-left
    has just the same effect as spinning the mouse button forwards/backwards.

<em>Frame zoom.</em>
    Dragging with the middle button to the right (and either up or down)
    drags out a frame;
    when the button is released, the plot will be zoomed in
    to cover (roughly) the area enclosed by the frame.
    Dragging left (and either up or down) does something like the opposite,
    you can zoom out using a similar (though not quite the same) mechanism.
