<h4>
<a name="timeNavigation">Time Navigation</a>
</h4>
<p>Horizontal navigation (panning and zooming left and right along the
shared time axis) affects all the stacked <a href="plotZones.html">zones</a>,
but vertical navigation (panning and zooming along the Y axis of each zone)
is done independently for each zone.
</p>
<p>The navigation actions for this window are:
<dl>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/DRAG1.png">
        Left drag</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Pan.</em>
    On the body of the plot this usually moves it around left/right.
    By default, vertical movement is inhibited since you don't normally
    want it for a time plot.
    To pan vertically, drag on the left of the Y axis for the zone
    you want to affect.
    It is also possible to configure panning on the body of the plot
    to be in both directions using the <b>Pan/Zoom Axes</b>
    in the <b>Navigation</b> axis configuration tab.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/DRAG3.png">
        Right drag (CTRL-drag)</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Stretch zoom.</em>
    On the body of the plot this usually stretches/squashes the plot
    centered on the horizontal position of the mouse.
    By default, vertical zooming is inhibited since you don't normally
    want it for a time plot.
    To zoom vertically, drag on the left of the Y axis for the zone
    you want to affect.
    It is also possible to configure zooming on the body of the plot
    to be in both directions using the <b>Pan/Zoom Axes</b>
    in the <b>Navigation</b> axis configuration tab.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/DRAG2.png">
        Center drag (SHIFT-drag)</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Frame zoom.</em>
    On the body of the plot, dragging right usually drags out a frame;
    when the button is released, the plot will be zoomed in
    to cover the area enclosed by the frame.
    Dragging left does something like the opposite, you can zoom out
    using a similar (though not quite the same) mechanism.
    By default, vertical zooming is inhibited since you don't normally
    want it for a time plot.
    To zoom in/out vertically, drag up/down on the left of the Y axis
    for the zone you want to affect.
    It is also possible to configure zooming on the body of the plot
    to be in both directions using the <b>Pan/Zoom Axes</b>
    in the <b>Navigation</b> axis configuration tab.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/MOUSE_WHEEL.png">
        Wheel</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Zoom.</em>
    Spinning the mouse wheel forwards/backwards will zoom horizontally in/out
    around the mouse position,
    just like dragging with the right button up-and-right or down-and-left.
