<p>Navigation in three dimensions with a two-dimensional screen and mouse
is a bit of a challenge.  However, the actions listed below should make it
fairly straightforward to navigate around points in 3d space to zoom in
on the regions that you are interested in.
The actions are quite like for the <a href="cubeNavigation.html">Cube Window</a>,
but all zooming is isotropic.

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/DRAG1.png">
        Left drag</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Rotate.</em>
    Rotates the view cube about its center.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/MOUSE_WHEEL.png">
        Wheel</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Zoom.</em>
    Spinning the mouse wheel forwards/backwards zooms the space in the
    view cube in/out around the cube center.  The mouse position does not
    affect it.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/DRAG3.png">
        Right drag (CTRL-drag)</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Zoom.</em>
    Zooming up-and-right/down-and-left does just the same as spinning the
    mouse wheel forwards/backwards.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/DRAG2.png">
        Center drag (SHIFT-drag)</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>2d pan.</em>
    Dragging with the center button pans the 3d space in the two dimensions
    best alighned with the plane of the screen.
    There is no movement in the third (mostly perpendicular to the screen)
    direction.
    </dd>

<dt>
<strong><img align="middle" alt="" src="%PLOTSERV_URL%/CLICK3.png">
        Right click (CTRL-click)</strong>
</dt>

<dd>
<em>Re-center.</em>
    Right-clicking identifies a position in a similar way to the
    left-click Select action, and then translates the plot so that point
    is at the center of the view cube.  This means that clicking on a
    cluster will put that cluster in the center of the cube.
    If you click on an empty region, a position half way between front
    and back of the cube at that X/Y position will be used.
    </dd>
