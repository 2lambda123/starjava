Classes for parsing VOTables from XML, and an implementation of StarTable
based on these.
The classes in this package fall into the following categories:
<dl>
<dt>VOTable structure classes:
<dd>Classes associated with the various elements in the VOTable DTD
    which define the hierarchical structure of a VOTable document.
    This sort of thing is similar to what can be provided by running
    an XML binding tool such as Breeze, though they are in this case
    hand written which leads to classes which are more compact and
    in most cases easier to use.
<dt>Table data access classes:
<dd>The <tt>Table</tt> class itself is a VOTable structure class, but
    has methods which cause the table cells themselves to be read 
    (from embedded XML or a stream) and returned.
    Most of the classes which do the work for this decoding are currently 
    package-private out of general conservatism and because you don't
    need any more than the methods on Table to get the table data.
    However, they could be publicised if there was some reason this
    was wanted.
<dt>Compatibility classes:
<dd>The {@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOStarTable} 
    class provides an adaptor between 
    a VOTable TABLE element and a {@link uk.ac.starlink.table.StarTable}.
</dl>

<p>Elements in the VOTable DTD are represented by instances of
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement} 
or one of its subclasses.  Not every VOTable 
element has a corresponding class, but the generic facilities
of <tt>VOElement</tt> can still be used for navigation if required.
In general a subclass of <tt>VOElement</tt> is provided in those 
cases for which functionality beyond that given by the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement#getAttribute} and
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement#getChildren} 
is required.

<p>The usual way of using these classes would be to create a 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOTable}
object using one of its constructors (file, uri, etc) and then use
the <tt>getChildren</tt> etc methods.  
However a static method {@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement#makeVOElement} 
is provided for constructing a <tt>VOElement</tt> from an 
XML {@link javax.xml.transform.Source},
so VOTable components can be made from bits of the 
DOM tree/SAX stream/whatever if
you're not interested in the whole document, 
or if you prefer to navigate around the XML using other techniques.
The purpose of using an XML <tt>Source</tt> here is twofold:
it provides neutrality between the DOM and SAX views (and others),
and it encourages the use of a System ID associated with the 
XML itself.  A System ID may well be required as a base for 
resolving relative URLs, for instance within 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.Link} or (especially)
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.Stream} elements.
The implementation is currently in terms of a DOM, but if
it becomes necessary to reimplement it in terms of a SAX-like model
in the future for reasons of efficiency it will be possible to 
do this without any change in software using this package.

<h2>Implementation Status</h2>
These classes currently provide read-only access to VOTables
according to the VOTable DTD version 1.0.
All three defined data implementations (TABLEDATA, FITS and BINARY)
are supported, though the BINARY support is so far entirely untested 
(hence probably not working); if someone can provide some test data
then some progress might be made on this.
