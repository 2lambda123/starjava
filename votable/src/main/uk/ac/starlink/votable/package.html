Classes for parsing VOTables from XML, and an implementation of StarTable
based on these.
The classes in this package fall into the following categories:
<dl>
<dt>VOTable structure classes:
<dd>Classes associated with the various elements in the VOTable DTD
    which define the hierarchical structure of a VOTable document.
    This sort of thing is similar to what can be provided by running
    an XML binding tool such as Breeze, though they are in this case
    hand written which leads to classes which are more compact and
    in most cases easier to use.
<dt>Table data access classes:
<dd>The <tt>Table</tt> class itself is a VOTable structure class, but
    has methods which cause the table cells themselves to be read 
    (from embedded XML or a stream) and returned.
    Most of the classes which do the work for this decoding are currently 
    package-private out of general conservatism and because you don't
    need any more than the methods on Table to get the table data.
    However, they could be publicised if there was some reason this
    was wanted.
<dt>Compatibility classes:
<dd>The {@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOStarTable} 
    and {@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOTableWriter}
    classes implement interfaces defined in the <tt>table</tt> package.
</dl>

<p>Elements in the VOTable DTD are represented by instances of
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement} 
or one of its subclasses.  Not every VOTable 
element has a corresponding class, but the generic facilities
of <tt>VOElement</tt> can still be used for navigation if required.
In general a subclass of <tt>VOElement</tt> is provided in those 
cases for which functionality beyond that given by the
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement#getAttribute} and
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement#getChildren} 
is required.

<p>The usual way of using these classes would be to create a 
{@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOTable}
object using one of its constructors (file, uri, etc) and then use
the <tt>getChildren</tt> etc methods.  
However a static method {@link uk.ac.starlink.votable.VOElement#makeVOElement} 
is provided for constructing a <tt>VOElement</tt> from an 
XML {@link javax.xml.transform.Source},
so VOTable components can be made from bits of the 
DOM tree/SAX stream/whatever if
you're not interested in the whole document, 
or if you prefer to navigate around the XML using other techniques.
The purpose of using an XML <tt>Source</tt> here is twofold:
it provides neutrality between the DOM and SAX views (and in principle others),
and it encourages the use of a System ID associated with the 
XML itself.  A System ID may well be required as a base for 
resolving relative URLs, for instance those within 
LINK or (especially) STREAM elements.

<p>A hybrid SAX/DOM parsing scheme is used, so that if a parse is done by 
this library (when using one of the non-DOM constructors of VOElement
or one of its subclasses) bulk data is not represented in the resulting
DOM.  In the case of TABLEDATA encoding, this means that the 
(potentially large) number of TR and TD nodes are parsed directly
using SAX and never introduced into the DOM.  In the case of FITS or
BINARY encoding in which the data is base64-encoded inline in the STREAM
element, this element is read and converted into table data during
the parse, and the screed of base64 text is not included in the DOM.
The user doesn't have to worry about all this of course, but it has
the effect that the parsing is fast and as memory-efficient as possible.
If the parsing has already been done (a DOMSource constructor is used
to construct a the VOElement instances) the library will use the 
text data in DOM nodes which exist in the presented DOM (it will not
excise them from the given DOM).

<h2>Implementation Status</h2>
These classes currently provide read-only access to VOTables
according to the VOTable DTD version 1.0.
All three defined data implementations (TABLEDATA, FITS and BINARY)
are fully supported for input and output.
