<a name="New%20Swing%20TableModel%20for%20displaying%20XML">
<h4>New Swing TableModel for displaying XML</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>

        
<p>Added a new Swing TableModel for displaying XML data in a Swing user interface. It uses
          an XPath based model to define the rows and column values.
          A table definition can be specified using a simple XML format and then loaded in a small amount of code.
          e.g. here's an example of a table that will list the servlets used in a web.xml document
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
&lt;table select="/web-app/servlet"&gt;
  &lt;column select="servlet-name"&gt;Name&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;column select="servlet-class"&gt;Class&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;column select="../servlet-mapping[servlet-name=$Name]/url-pattern"&gt;Mapping&lt;/column&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
          
<p>
          Notice the use of the $Name XPath variable to access other cells on the row.
          Here's the pseudo code to display a table for an XML document.
          <br>
</p>

<pre>
Document tableDefinition = ...;
Document source = ...;
TableModel tableModel = new XMLTableModel( tableDefinition, source );
JTable table = new JTable( tableModel );
</pre>
        
<p>
          There is a sample program in samples/swing/JTableTool which will display any table definition
          for a given source XML document. There is an example table definition for the periodic table
          in xml/swing/tableForAtoms.xml.

<a name="Registering%20Namespace%20URIs%20for%20XPath">
<h4>Registering Namespace URIs for XPath</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
        
<p>Added a new helper method to make it easier to create namespace contexts for doing
          namespace aware XPath expressions. The new setNamespaceURIs(Map) method on XPath makes it easier
          to pass in the prefixes and URIs you wish to use in an XPath expression. Here's an example of it in action
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
Map uris = new HashMap();
uris.put( "SOAP-ENV", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" );
uris.put( "m", "urn:xmethodsBabelFish" );        
XPath xpath = document.createXPath( "/SOAP-ENV:Envelope/SOAP-ENV:Body/m:BabelFish" );
xpath.setNamespaceURIs( uris );        
Node element = xpath.selectSingleNode( document );
</pre>
        
<p>In addition DocumentFactory has a setXPathNamespaceURIs(Map) method so that common namespace URIs can be associated with
          a DocumentFactory so namespace prefixes can be used across many XPath expressions in an easy way. e.g.
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
// register prefixes with my factory
Map uris = new HashMap();
uris.put( "SOAP-ENV", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" );
uris.put( "m", "urn:xmethodsBabelFish" );        

DocumentFactory factory = new DocumentFactory();
factory.setXPathNamespaceURIs( uris );

// now parse a document using my factory
SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();
reader.setDocumentFactory( factory );
Document doc = reader.read( "soap.xml" );

// now lets use the prefixes
Node element = doc.selectSingleNode( "/SOAP-ENV:Envelope/SOAP-ENV:Body/m:BabelFish" );
</pre>

<a name="Whitespace%20handling">
<h4>Whitespace handling</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>

        
<p>There is a new <i>mergeAdjacentText</i> option available on SAXReader 
        to concatenate adjacent text nodes into a single Text node. 
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>
        In addition there is a new <i>stripWhitespaceText</i> option to strip text which occurs between 
        start/end tags which only consists of whitespace. 
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>
        For example, parsing the following XML with the stripWhitespaceText option enabled
        and the mergeAdjacentText option enabled
        will result in a single child node of the parent element, rather than 3 (2 text nodes containing whitespace and one element).
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
&lt;parent&gt;
  &lt;child&gt;foo&lt;/child&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;
</pre>
        
<p>
        Note that this option will not break most mixed content markup such as the following, 
        since its only whitespace between tag start/ends that gets removed; non-whitespace strings are not trimmed.
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
&lt;p&gt;hello &lt;b&gt;James&lt;/b&gt; how are you?&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
        
<p>
        Both these options together can improve the parsing performance by around 10-12% depending on the 
        structure of the document. Though the whitespace layout of the XML document will be lost, so only
        use these modes in data-centric applications like XML messaging and SOAP.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>
        So a typical SOAP or XML messaging developer, who may care more about performance than
        preserving exact whitespace layout, may use the following code to 
        make the SAX parsing more optimal.
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();
reader.setMergeAdjacentText( true );
reader.setStripWhitespaceText( true );
Document doc = reader.read( "soap.xml" );
</pre>

<h4>Patches</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
        
<p>Applied patch to HTMLWriter to fix bug found by Dominik Deimling that was not correctly outputting CDATA sections correctly.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Patched the setName() method on Element so that elements can be renamed. Also added a new setQName() to the Element interface so that elements can be renamed in a namespace aware manner. Thanks to Robert Lebowitz for this.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied fix to bug found by Manfred Lotz that XMLWriter in whitespace trimming mode would sometimes not correctly insert a space when text is seperated by newlines. The Test case testWhitespaceBug() in org.dom4j.TestXMLWriter reproduces the bug that has now been fixed.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied patches supplied by Stefan Graeber that enhance the datatype support to support included schemata and derived element types.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied patches suggested by Omer van der Horst Jansen to enable dom4j to fully work
          properly on JDK1.1 platforms. There were some uses of java.util.Stack which have been changed to ArrayList.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied patches supplied by Maarten Coene that fixes some issues with using the correct
          DocumentFactory when using the DOM implementation.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Updated the MSV support to comply with the latest MSV version, 1.12 (Nov 01 2001).
          In addition the MSVDemo.java in dom4j/src/samples/validate has been replaced by
          JARVDemo.java which now uses the <a href="http://iso-relax.sourceforge.net/JARV/">JARV</a> API 
          to validate a dom4j 
          document using the <a href="http://www.sun.com/xml/">MSV</a> implementation.
          This demo can validate any XML document against any DTD, XML Schema, Relax NG, Relax or Trex
          schema - thanks to the excellent JARV API and MSV library.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied patches supplied by Steen Lehmann that fixes handling of external DTD entities in SAXContentHandler 
          and fix the XML output of the ExternalEntityDecl
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied patch to bug found by Steen Lehmann that XPath expressions on the root element
          were not correctly handling namespaces correctly. The test case is demonstrated in
          dom4j/src/test/org/dom4j/xpath/TestSelectSingleNode.java
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Added patch found by Howard Moore when using XTags that XPath string values which contained
        strings with entities, such as the use of &amp;amp; in a text, would result in redundant spaces
        occuring, breaking URLs.

<a name="New%20features">
<h4>New features</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
        
<p>Added a new package, org.dom4j.dtd which contains some DTD declaration classes which are added to the DocumentType interfaces
        List of declarations. This is useful for finding out details of the attribute or element delcarations inside either the 
        internal or external DTD subset of a document. 
        <br>
</p>

        
<p>To expand internal or external DTD subsets when parsing with SAXReader use the 2 properties on SAXReader (and SAXContentHandler). 
        <br>
</p>


<pre>
SAXReader reader = new SAXReader();
reader.setIncludeInternalDTDDeclarations( true );
reader.setIncludeExternalDTDDeclarations( true );
Document doc = reader.read( "foo.xml" );

DocumentType docType = doc.getDocType();
List internalDecls = docType.getInternalDeclarations();
List externalDecls = docType.getExternalDeclarations();
</pre>

        
<p>This new feature means that XML documents which use internal DTD subsets, external DTDs or a mixture of internal and external
        DTD subsets can now be properly round tripped.
        <br>
</p>

        
<p>Note that there appears to be a bug in Crimson 1.1.3 which does not properly differentiate between internal or external DTD 
        subsets. Refer to the <a href="http://dom4j.org/javadoc/org/xml/sax/ext/LexicalHandler.html#startDTD(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)">startDTD()</a>
        method of <a href="http://dom4j.org/javadoc/org/xml/sax/ext/LexicalHandler.html">LexicalHandler</a>
        for details of how startEntity/endEntity is meant to demark external DTD subsets.
        <br>
</p>

        
<p>
        Its our intention to expand internal DTD subsets by default (so that documents can be properly round tripped by default)
        but require external DTD subsets to be explicitly enabled via the property on the SAXReader (or SAXContentHandler). 
        This bug in Crimson causes all DTD declarations to appear as internal DTD subsets, which both is a performance overhead
        and breaks round tripping of documents which just use external DTD declarations. So until this matter is resolved
        both internal and external declarations are not expanded by default.
        <br>
</p>

        
<p>
        Note that the code works perfectly against Xerces.

<p>Applied patch submitted by Yuxin Ruan which fixes some issues with XML Schema Data Type support
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Followed Dennis Sosnoski's suggestion, adding a null text String to an Element
          now throws an IllegalArgumentException.
          To ensure that the IllegalArgumentException is not thrown its advisable
          to check for null first. For example...
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
Element element = ...;
String text = ...;

// might throw IllegalArgumentException
// if text == null
element.addText( text );

// safer to do this
if ( text != null ) {
  element.addText( text );
}
</pre>

        
<p>Fixed problem found by Kesav Kumar Kolla whereby a deserialized Document could have problems if 
          new elements were attempted to be added. The problem was an issue with DocumentFactory not correctly
          deserializing itself properly.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Fixed problem found by David Hooker with Ant build file for the 
        binary and source distribution that was not including the manifest file
        in the distribution. 
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Applied patch submitted by Lari Hotari that was causing the XMLWriter to fail when used as a 
        SAX XMLFilter or ContentHandler to turn SAX events into XML text. Thanks Lari!
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Fixed bug found by Kohsuke Kawaguchi that there was a problem in XMLWriter during its serialization of
        a document which redeclared the default namespace prefix. It turned out to be a bug in
        org.dom4j.tree.NamespaceStack where redeclarations of namespace prefixes were not being handled properly
        during serialization. The test cases in org.dom4j.TestXMLWriter and org.dom4j.TestNamespaces have been improved
        to test these features more rigorously.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Fixed bug found by Toby
        that was causing a security exception in applets when using a DocumentFactory.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Implemented the suggestion by Kesav Kumar, that the detach() method now returns the node (this) so that moving 
        nodes from one part of a document to any another can now be one line of code. Here's an example of it in use.
        <br>
</p>

<pre>
Document doc1 = ...;
Document doc2; = ...;
Element destination = doc2.getRootElement();
Element source = doc1.selectSingleNode( "//foo[@style='bar']" );

// lets move the source to the destination
destination.add( source.detach() );
</pre>
        
<p>Added better checking in selectSingleNode() implementation so that XPath expressions which do not
          return a Node throw a meaningful exception (not ClassCastException) informing the user of
          why the XPath expression did not succeed.
        <br>
</p>
        
<p>Added patch found by Kesav Kumar that a document containing null Strings would cause a NullPointerException
          to be thrown if it was passed into SAXWriter (used by the JAXP - XSLT code). Now the SAXWriter will
          quietly ignore null Strings, as will XMLWriter.

<p>Added helper method setXMLFilter() to SAXReader making it easier to install SAX filters to filter or preprocess SAX events
          before a dom4j Document is created. Also added a new sample program called sax.FilterDemo that demonstrates how to use a SAX filter
          with dom4j.
          <br>
</p>
          
<p>
            Added full support for <a href="http://jaxen.org">Jaxen</a> function, namespace and variable context interfaces.
            This allows the XPath engine to be fully customized. e.g.
<pre>
XPath xpath = document.createXPath( "//foo[@code='123']" );

// customize function, namespace and variable contexts
xpath.setFunctionContext( myFunctionContext );
xpath.setNamespaceContext( myNamespaceContext );
xpath.setVariableContext( myVariableContext );

List nodes = xpath.selectNodes( document );
</pre>
          
<br>
</p>
          
<p>
            Added new helper class <code>org.dom4j.util.XMLErrorHandler</code> which 
            turns SAX ErrorHandler callbacks into XML that can then be output in a JAXM or SOAP message
            or styled via XSLT or whatever.
          <br>
</p>
          
<p>Added new helper method <code>DocumentHelper.makeElement(doc, "a/b/c")</code> which will
            navigate from a document or element to the given simple path, creating new elements along the way if need be.
            This allows elements to be found or created using a simple path expression mechansim.
          <br>
</p>
          
<p>Added helper method getQName(String qualifiedName) to Element so that easier element name matching can be done. Here are some examples of it in use.
<pre>
// find all elements with a local name of "foo" 
// in any namespace
List list = element.elements( "foo" );

// find all elements with a local name "foo" 
// and the default namespace URI
List list = element.elements( element.getQName( "foo" ) );

// find all elements which match the local name "foo" 
// and the namespace URI mapped to the "x" prefix
List list = element.elements( element.getQName( "x:foo" ) );
</pre>
          
<br>
</p>
          
<p>

            Added helper method on <code>org.dom4j.DocumentFactory</code> called <code>getQNames</code>
            that returns a List of all the QNames that were used to parse the documents.
          <br>
</p>
          
<p>
            Added an EntityResolver property to SAXReader to make it easier to configure a specific EntityResolver.

            Fixed the behaviour of DocumentFactory.createXPathFilter() to use XPath filtering
            rather than XSLT style patterns. One of the major differences is that an XSLT pattern
            (used in the &lt;xsl:template match="pattern"/&gt; element in XSLT) works slightly 
            differently. An element &lt;foo&gt; would match an XSLT pattern "foo" whereas an
            element &lt;bar&gt; could match an XPath filter "foo" if it contained a child &lt;foo&gt; 
            element.

            no namespace. An attribute does not inherit the default namespace - the only way to put an attribute

            Moved the XML Schema Data Type supporting classes in org.dom4j.schema.Schema* to
            org.dom4j.datatype.Datatype*. This should avoid confusion and better describe the
            intent of the classes, to implement Data typing, rather than schema validation.
            We hope to use the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/">MSV</a> 
            library for all of our schema validation requirements.

<h4>Full support for the Jaxen XPath engine</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
            
<p>The XPath engine in dom4j has been migrated to using <a href="http://jaxen.org">Jaxen</a>.
              This single XPath engine can be plugged into any model such that Jaxen will support
              DOM, dom4j, EXML and JDOM. Hopefully we'll get Jaxen working on Java Beans too.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>
              In general this will mean a much better, more compliant and more bug-free XPath
              engine for dom4j as it will be used extensively across XML object models.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>
              Already numerous irregularities have been fixed in the XPath support in dom4j.
              We have donated the dom4j XPath test harness to Jaxen so that we now have a large
              rigorous test harness to ensure correct XPath behaviour - this test harness is run
              against all 4 current XML object models to ensure consistent behaviour and valid 
              XPath compliance.             
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>
              We are also in the process of migrating over our XPath extension functions as 
              well as adding additional XPath functions such as those defined in XSLT and XPointer.

<p>Fixed bug in getNamespaceForPrefix() where if the prefix is null or ""
               and there is a default namespace defined, this method was returning 
               a namespace instance with the incorrect URI.

               using namespace aware mode by default.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed a number of issues relating to namespaces and the redefinition of namespace prefixes.
              We now have a quite aggressive JUnit test harness to ensure that we handle namespace URIs
              correctly when prefixes are mapped and unmapped.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Applied patch from Andrew Wason for HTMLWriter to support the full
              HTML 4.01 DTD elements which do not require proper XML element closes.
              The new elements are PARAM, AREA, LINK, COL, BASE and META.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed bug found by Dennis Sosnoski that SAX warnings were causing
              exceptions to be thrown by the SAXReader. Now warnings are silently ignored.
              If you want to detect warnings then an ErrorHandler should be registered with the
              SAXReader.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Patched bug that was also found by Jonathan Doughty for the non-standard
               behaviour of the FilterIterator. Also added Jonathan's JUnit test case
               to the distribution so that this problem should not come back. 
            <br>
</p>

              additional namespace attributes were appearing.
              Now the TestRoundTrip JUnit test case includes JAXP round tripping.

              This method was suggested by Dane Foster.
              This method returns true if the node is a Branch (i.e. an Element or Document)

<p>Fixed bug found by Chris Nokleberg when using the UserDataElement
               that the clone() and createCopy() methods were not correctly 
               copying the user data object. A JUnit test case has been added that
               tests this fix (org.dom4j.TestUserData).
               If any deep copying of user data objects is required then
               UserDataElement now has a method getCopyOfUserData()
               which can be overloaded to perform a deep copy of any user data
               objects if required.               
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Minor patch for dom4j implementors wishing to create their own 
              QName implementations. Previously the DocumentFactory class was
              hardwired to use QNameCache internally which was hard wired to 
              only create QName instances.
              Now some factory methods have been added such that you can derive 
              your own DocumentFactory which uses your own
              QNameCache which creates your own QName classes.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>If JAXP can be found in the CLASSPATH then it is now used first by
              the SAXReader to find the correct SAX parser class. 
              We have found that sometimes (e.g. Tomcat 4.0 beta 6) the value
              of the org.xml.sax.driver system property is set to a class which is not 
              in the CLASSPATH but a valid JAXP parser is present. 
              So now we try JAXP first, then the SAX system property then if all else fails
              we use the bundled Aelfred SAX parser.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed XPath bug found by James Elson that the path /foo[@a and @b] or
              /foo[@a='1' and @b='2'] was no longer working correctly. This is now fixed
              and many tests of this nature have been added to the JUnit test harness.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed some namespace related bugs found by Steen Lehmann.
              It appears that for a document of:-

           <br>
</p>

<pre>
&lt;a xmlns="dummyNamespace"&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;c&gt;Hello&lt;/c&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
           
<p>Then the path /a/b/c will not find anything - this is correct according to the XPath spec.
              Instead the path /*[name()='a']/*[name()='b']/*[name()='c'] is required.
              These changes have been applied to getPath() and getUniquePath() such that
              these methods now work, irrespectively of the namespaces used in a document.
              Finally many new test cases have been added to validate a variety of XPath
              expressions with various uses of namespaces.
            <br>
</p>
           
<p>SAXWriter now fully supports the SAX feature "http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes".
              Failure to support this feature properly was causing problems
              when outputting a dom4j Document using JAXP - the namespace declarations often did not appear correctly.
            <br>
</p>
           
<p>Patched bug in XMLWriter which caused multiple duplicate namespace declarations to sometimes appear.

<p>The <a href="http://saxpath.org">SAXPath</a> project is a

              SAX in that the API abstracts away the details of parsing XPath

              Now dom4j uses SAXPath for its XPath parsing which results in faster XPath parsing

<p>Improved the setContent() semantics on Branch (and so Element and Document) such that the 
              parent and document relationships are correctly removed for old content and added for new content.
              As a helper method, the setContent() method will clone any content nodes which are already
              part of an existing document. So for example the following code will clone the content of a document.
<pre>
    Document doc1 = ...;
    Document doc2 = DocumentHelper.createDocument();  
    doc2.setContent( doc1.content() );
</pre>
              Though this behaviour is much more useful when used with elements...
<pre>
    Element sourceElement;
    Element destElement;

    // copy the content of sourceElemenet
    destElement.setContent( sourceElement.content() );

            XML so we recommend sending XML text over RMI rather than serialization if possible. Over time we will tune
            the serialization implementation to be at least as fast as using the text format (even if that means under the

<p>A document can now be constructed more easily now that the addXXX() methods
              return a reference to the Document or Element which created them.
              An example is shown below
            <br>
</p>

<pre>
import org.dom4j.Document;
import org.dom4j.DocumentHelper;
import org.dom4j.Element;

public class Foo {

    public Document createDocument() {
        Document document = DocumentHelper.createDocument();
        Element root = document.addElement( "root" );

        Element author1 = root.addElement( "author" )
            .addAttribute( "name", "James" )
            .addAttribute( "location", "UK" )
            .addText( "James Strachan" );
        
        Element author2 = root.addElement( "author" )
            .addAttribute( "name", "Bob" )
            .addAttribute( "location", "Canada" )
            .addText( "Bob McWhirter" );

        return document;
    }
}
</pre>
            
<p>
              Note that the addElement() method returns the <b>new</b> child element
              not the parent element.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>
              To promote consistency, the Element.setAttributeValue() method is now deprecated
              and should be replaced with Element.addAttribute().

<h4>Patches and bug fixes</h4>

<p>Applied Theo's patch for cloning of Documents correctly 
              together with JUnit test cases to ensure this keeps working.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Applied Rob Wilson's patch that NullPointerExceptions 
              were being thrown if a Document is output with the XMLWriter
              and an attribute value is null.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed problem found by Nicolas Fonrose that XPath expressions
              using namespace prefixes were not working correcty.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed problem found by Thomas Nichols whereby default namespaces
              with no prefix were not being processed correctly. 
              As a result of finding this bug we now have a rigorous JUnit round trip test 
              harness in place which highlighted a number of issues with namespaces when
              round tripping from dom4j to SAX to DOM to Text and back again.
              These issues have now been fixed and should not show up again hopefully.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Fixed some detach() bugs that were found with Attributes.
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Default encoding is now "UTF-8" rather than "UTF8". Thanks to
              Thomas Nichols for spotting that one. Also the default 
              line seperator when using XMLWriter is now "\n" rather than "\r\n"
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>If an XMLWriter is used with an OutputStream then an explicit call to 
            flush() is no longer required after calling write(Document)
            <br>
</p>
            
<p>Some housekeeping was performed in the naming of some implementation classes.
              The old XPathXXX.java classes in the org.dom4j.tree package 
              where XXX = Attribute, CDATA, 
              Comment, Entity, ProcessingInstruction and Text have been renamed to
              DefaultXXX and the corresponding DefaultXXX has been renamed to
              FlyweightXXX. This makes it clearer the purpose of these implementation
              classes. The default implementations of the leaf nodes are mutable but cannot
              be shared across elements. The FlyweightXXX implementations are immutable
              and can be shared across nodes and documents.

<p>The <code>org.dom4j.io.OutputFormat</code> class now has a new helper
            method to make it easier to create pretty print formatting objects.
            The new method is <code>OutputFormat.createPrettyPrint()</code>.
            So to pretty print some XML (trimming all whitespace and indenting nicely)
            the following code should do the job...
          <br>
</p>

<pre>
    OutputFormat format = OutputFormat.createPrettyPrint();
    XMLWriter writer = new XMLWriter( out, format );
    writer.write( document );
    writer.close();
</pre>
          
<p>
<code>SAXReader.read(String url)</code> can now accept either 
            a URL or a file name which makes things a little easier.
            The logic uses the existence of a ':' in the url String to determine if
            it should be treated as a URL or a File name. 
          <br>
</p>
          
<p>For more explicit control over whether documents are Files or URLs
            call <code>SAXReader.read(File file)</code> or <code>SAXReader.read(URL url)</code>
          
<br>
</p>
          
<p>A new extension function, <i>matrix-concat()</i> was submitted by 
          James Pereira.
          By default, doing <i>concat()</i> functions in XPath the 'string-value' is taken
          for each argument.
          So for a document:-<br>
</p>

<pre>
&lt;root project="dom4j"&gt;
    &lt;contributor&gt;James Pereira&lt;/contributor&gt;
    &lt;contributor&gt;Bob McWhirter&lt;/contributor&gt;
&lt;/root;&gt;
</pre>
        
<p>Then the XPath<br>
</p>


<pre>
concat( 'thanks ', /root/contributor )
</pre>

        
<p>would return<br>
</p>


<pre>
"thanks James Pereira"
</pre>

      
<p>as the <i>/root/contributor</i> expression matches a node set of 2 
      elements, but the "string-value" takes the first elements text.
      Whereas <i>matrix-contact</i> will do a cartesian product of all the 
      arguments and then do the concatenation of each combination of nodes. So
      <br>
</p>


<pre>
matrix-concat( 'thanks ', /root/contributor )
</pre>

      
<p>will produce<br>
</p>


<pre>
"thanks James Pereira"
"thanks Bob McWhirter"
</pre>

      
<p>The cartesian product is done such that multiple paths can be used.
      <br>
</p>


<pre>
matrix-concat( 'thanks ', /root/contributor, ' for working on ', '/@project' )
</pre>

      
<p>will produce<br>
</p>


<pre>
"thanks James Pereira for working on dom4j"
"thanks Bob McWhirter for working on dom4j"
</pre>

      
<p>Fixed bug where <code>XMLWriter.write(Object)</code> was not correctly
        writing a Document instance.
      <br>
</p>
      
<p>Finally, a couple of small issues with the build process have been fixed.
      The dom4j.jar no longer contains any SAX or DOM classes (they are all in dom4j-full.jar)
      And the Antlr grammar files for the XPath parser are now corrrectly 
      included in the binary  distribution.
