java CVS repository.

r0-1:
   Date:   20-DEC-2002(?)
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   Initial tag.

r0-2:
   Date:   11-FEB-2003
   Tagger: Mark Taylor
   Info:   Corresponds to Treeview 2.1.  Certain packages in the repository
           were not tagged at this point since they have broken build/test
           targets: the new packages COCO, PAL, RV are omitted because the
           install targets don't quite work and recent changes related to
           HDX are omitted because they cause some of the test targets to
           fail (FITS, HDS).
