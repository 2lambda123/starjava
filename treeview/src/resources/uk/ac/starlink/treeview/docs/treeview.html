<h1>Treeview</h1>

<p>The treeviewer gives a graphical view of hierarchical data.
It can be used to display directory structures, HDS files, NDFs 
and a number of other data structures.</p>

<p>The display has two parts: the tree panel (initially on the left)
displays the tree structure and the the information panel
(where you see this help text) may show additional information about
the selected node.  The relative sizes of the two panels can be changed
by dragging the divider which separates them, and their positions 
can be changed using the <i>View</i> menu or the toolbar buttons.</p>

<p>The tree panel shows a number of nodes,
one for each item given on the treeview command line.
Each node is represented on a line, which contains an icon 
indicating what kind of node it is, its name, and perhaps some brief
descriptive information.  At the left of the line, if the node
may have <i>children</i>, is a <i>handle</i> which indicates whether it is
currently expanded (children visible) or collapsed (children invisible).</p>

<p>When a node is selected some additional details may be 
displayed in the information panel.

<p>Operation is quite intuitive: 
<ul>
<li> select a node (to view additional data) by clicking once on the line
<li> expand/collapse a node (to see its children) by clicking 
     once on the handle
<li> right-click on a node to refresh it or see its alter-egos
</ul>
There are other ways of performing these actions using 
the mouse, menus, toolbar and keyboard.

<p>The toolbar "++" button does a recursive expand on the selected node. 
This expands the node, and all its children, and all its children's
children ....  If you attempt this on a large structure (e.g. a 
directory containing many files and subdirectories) it can expand
an awful lot of nodes, so use it with caution.
The "--" button does a recursive collapse on the selected node.
This causes the treeviewer to forget all about the children of
the selected node, so if it is expanded later it will have to 
read the data again.
There are equivalents of these buttons in the <i>Tree</i> menu.
