<h2>Invoking Treeview</h2>

<p>The usual way of invoking Treeview from the command line is to type
<pre>
   treeview name name ...
</pre>
where the <tt>name</tt>s are descriptions of items you want to display.
These will normally be file or directory names, but may be something else like
an HDS path or XPath expression (the latter is not implemented yet...).
If only one name is specified on the command line it will be opened 
automatically, but if several are given they will initially appear
closed.

<p>Although Treeview itself does not understand wild cards, your shell probably
does, so in most environments doing something like
<pre>
   treeview *.sdf
</pre>
will open Treeview with all the HDS container files in the current 
directory displayed.

<p>Alternatively you can just type
<pre>
   treeview
</pre>
which will display all the items in your current directory.

<h4>Text mode</h4>

<p>Treeview can run in text mode as well as in its normal graphical window.
If you invoke it with the <tt>-text</tt> flag, then instead of 
displaying its usual window, it will give you a text dump of the
indicated items down to their full depth.  This can be useful 
for a quick look into structured files.  Here is the result of
doing this in a directory which contains a couple of FITS files:
<pre>
   treeview -text *.fits
   + [FIT] cube.fits
     - [IMG] Primary HDU  (Image (120,120,8,1) )
   + [FIT] tables.fits
     - [IMG] Primary HDU  (Image)
     - [TBL] HDU 1  ASCII table (13x138)
     - [TBL] HDU 2  Binary table (3x881)
</pre>
You can see a more impressive example if you do:
<pre>
   treeview -demo -text
</pre>

<h4>Other flags</h4>

<p>Treeview has a number of other command line flags which are mostly
concerned with forcing nodes to be interpreted in a particular way.
These are intended mainly for debugging purposes, but you can
see a usage synopsis by doing
<pre>
   treeview -help
</pre>
