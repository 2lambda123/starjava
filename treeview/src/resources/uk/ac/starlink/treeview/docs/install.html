<h1><img src="IconFactory.TREE_LOGO">&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Treeview</h1>

<h2><img src="IconFactory.TREE">&nbsp;Requisites</h2>

<p>Treeview is written in java using J2SE1.4.

It makes use of some optional components (JAI, JNIAST and JNIHDS),
which are installed separately; however if these are absent the program
will run quite happily with the corresponding facilities disabled.

<p>Since the core program is written in pure java, it will run anywhere
that a Java 1.4 virtual machine is installed, and this means it can
run on a wide range of platforms.  It has been tested on Linux, 
Solaris, Compaq Tru64 Unix and MS Windows.

<p>The following procedure describes how to install the Starlink 
java classes from scratch.  
This gets you Treeview plus some other applications
(SPLAT and SoG) and utilities (NDTools), 
along with all the Starlink java infrastructure classes
and a number of third party class libraries required by them, as
well as the Java Runtime Environment itself.
All these are documented elsewhere.
Not all of this infrastructures is used by Treeview, but it is 
currently distributed together for ease of installation and maintenance.

<h2><img src="IconFactory.TREE">&nbsp;Installation procedure</h2>

<p>Follow these steps:
<h3>1.  Install version 1.4 of the Java Runtime Environment if you do not
    already have it.</h3>

    If you already have java installed, find out what version it is;
    something like "<tt>java -version</tt>" will probably tell you this.
    If the version is lower than 1.4.0, you will need to replace this
    version or install a separate one for Treeview to use.
 
    <p>You can get versions for Linux, Solaris/SPARC, Solaris/x86 and
    MS Windows from 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">Sun's web site</a>
    (you only need the JRE download rather than the SDK, 
    unless you will be doing development work).  MS Windows users can use Sun's 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/download.html">automatic download</a>
    procedure if they prefer.
    J2SE Runtime Enviroments (sometimes called JVM or Java Virtual Machines)
    for other platforms may be available from operating system vendors;
    Sun maintains a <a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi">list
    of java implementations for other platforms</a>; make sure you get
    version 1.4.0 or higher.

<h3>2.  Install Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) <i>(Optional)</i></h3>

    JAI is used for graphical display of arrays; without this you will
    not be able to see image-type display of data files.
    <p>Download this package from the <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download-1_1_1_01.html">Sun download site</a>.
    Unless you are doing development, you will want to use the
    "JRE install" option (note the CLASSPATH install will <i>not</i> work
    without some changes, because of the way that Treeview does its 
    class loading).
    <p>Although Sun only advertises versions for Solaris, Linux and MS Windows,
    it is possible to use these on other platforms; if you have a different
    platform download, say the Linux one and install it anyway.
    This should provide the necessary imaging functionality, 
    but without some platform-speicific graphical acceleration.
    You may also see some complaints at runtime about missing components.
    

<h3>3.  Install the Starlink Java classes</h3>
    Download the Starlink java classes package as a 
    <a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava.zip">zip archive</a> or 
    <a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava.tar.gz">compressed tar archive</a>
    and unpack it somewhere suitable.


<h3>4.  Install platform-specific shared libraries <i>(Optional)</i></h3>
    Platform-specific code comprises two libraries:
    <ul>
    <li>JNIAST handles world coordinate system processing - without it
        display of coordinates on images and use of external programs
        SPLAT and SoG will be unavailable.
    <li>JNIHDS handles processing of Starlink HDS and NDF files - without it
        Treeview will not be able to look inside these files at all.
    </ul>
    <p>Download the zipped archive appropriate for your system:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava-i386.tar.gz">i386</a> for Linux systems on Intel hardware
    <li><a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava-sparc.tar.gz">sparc</a> for Sun Solaris systems on SPARC hardware
    <li><a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava-alpha.tar.gz">alpha</a> for Compaq Tru64 Unix on alpha hardware
    <li><a href="ftp://andromeda.star.bris.ac.uk/pub/star/starjava/starjava-x86.zip">x86</a> for MS Windows operating systems on Intel hardware
    </ul>

<p>Unpack this platform-specific archive in the same directory as the 
starjava archive in step (3).  The files are in different directories,
for different platforms, so more than one of these can be installed
in the same place.

<p><i>Notes:</i>
<ul>
<li>The MS Windows version has not been tested yet, and it does not 
    include JNIHDS.  Watch this space
<li>The Tru64 Unix version currently lacks the JNIAST component;
    it's available on request, but seems to have some bugs.
<li>We don't have
    the hardware to support other platforms, but if you are interested in
    helping to compile code for other platforms, please get in touch. 
<li>In the longer term we hope to migrate the functionality supplied by
    these modules to pure java, for full platform independence.
</ul>



<h2><img src="IconFactory.TREE">&nbsp;Away you go</h2>

<p>To invoke the Treeview tool you should now put the 
"<tt>bin</tt>" directory (which contains the "<tt>java</tt>" command) 
from the JRE which 
you installed at step (1) on your path,
and you can then use the script
"<tt>starjava/bin/treeview</tt>" under where you unpacked the starlink
classes in step (3) to invoke Treeview.
