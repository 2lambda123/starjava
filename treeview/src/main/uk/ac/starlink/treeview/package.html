Classes for hierarchical browsing of directory and data structures.
<p>
Using the classes available in this package, heirarchical data 
structures can be viewed interactively.
The GUI side is based on a Swing <code>JTree</code> component,
and the underlying data model is supplied by classes conforming
to the package's <code>DataNode</code> interface.
<p>
Adding knowledge of a new type of hierarchical data is done by
providing a new class implementating <code>DataNode</code>.
Such new <code>DataNode</code> implementors must be able to do the
following:
<ul>
<li>supply their children on request (though not necessarily know 
    what type of node each child represents) - this should be done
    by using a <code>DataNodeFactory</code>
<li>provide a textual and iconic representation of itself
<li>possible provide a <code>JComponent</code> giving fuller details
    of itself
<li>have one or more constructors based on fairly generic objects such
    as <code>String</code>, <code>File</code>, other types of 
    <code>DataNode</code>
</ul>
The <code>DataNodeFactory</code> class should then be informed of
the existence of the new class.
<p>



Currently extant <code>DataNode</code> implementors are
<dl>
<dt><code>DefaultDataNode</code>:
<dd>trivial implementation

<dt><code>FileDataNode</code>:
<dd>the Unix file system or files/directories within it

<dt><code>ZipFileDataNode</code>:
<dd>a Zip file (or a Jar file)

<dt><code>ZipEntryDataNode</code>:
<dd>an entry in a Zip file (or a Jar file)

<dt><code>HDSDataNode</code>:
<dd>an HDS file

<dt><code>ARYDataNode</code>:
<dd>an ARY structure representing an HDS array (including special 
    knowledge not known to <code>HDSDataNode</code>)

<dt><code>WCSDataNode</code>:
<dd>an ARY structure representing a World Coordinate System component
    encoded in an AST FrameSet

<dt><code>NDFDataNode</code>:
<dd>an NDF structure (including special knowledge not available to 
    <code>HDSDataNode</code>)

<dt><code>FITSDataNode</code>:
<dd>a FITS file, which may contain one or more HDUs

<dt><code>HDUDataNode</code>:
<dd>a Header plus Data Unit, which may be found in a FITS file
</dl>

Further implementors are planned for the future:
<dl>
<dt><code>NDGDataNode</code>
<dd>an NDG expression whose children are the NDFs represented by it
</dl>
