            Quick Start for the Starlink JAVA build system
            ==============================================

   Prerequisites
   -------------

First make sure you have a J2SE SDK available. Downloads are available
from:

   http://java.sun.com/

This should probably match the version of the JRE distributed by
Starlink (see the /star/java directory or equivalent). We cannot
distribute the SDK for licensing reasons.

You will also need to have JAI installed as part of the SDK. JAI is
the "Java Advanced Imaging API" which is currently part of SUNs
"Desktop Java". The version of JAI being used can be determined from
the README-jai.txt file in the Starlink JRE package (see the
/star/java/jre directory).

Now define STAR_JAVA to point at the "java" command of this:

   setenv STAR_JAVA /some/where/j2sdk1.x.x/bin/java

Alternatively install the SDK into /star/java and create a file
"jdkhome" in this directory that contains the full name of the host
directory (in the same fashion as the jrehome file found there).

   Build ANT
   ---------

Since it's been necessary to add some extension tasks to ANT you need
to use the local release. To do this look in the "ant" directory and
follow the instructions in the "README.Starlink" file.

If you already have a STARJAVA installation you may be able to use the
ANT script found in the /star/starjava/bin directory, but if ANT
reports that it is finding unexpected elements in the build files you
will need to rebuild ANT.

   Start using the new ANT
   -----------------------

If you have built and installed ANT you now need to add the "java/bin"
directory that you should have created to your PATH (this the
directory that is now equivalent to "/star/bin" and would eventually
be "/star/starjava/bin" if released as part of the current
system). You need the new "ant" command to get our extensions and to
use JUnit.

   Perform the build
   -----------------

Just type:

   % ant build

and wait a while. If it reports that you cannot compile the Java
files, make sure that the SDK is on your PATH (a javac command is
required).

   Install everything
   ------------------

   % ant install


   Test the installation
   ---------------------

If this all worked you should now be able to type:

   % ../bin/treeview

To use applications just SPLAT, FROG and SoG you need to run the
various scripts found in the sub-directories of ../bin (if you have
STARJAVA already installed check the environment variables and aliases
and re-define these as appropriate).
