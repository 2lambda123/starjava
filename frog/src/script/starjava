#  Name:
#     starjava

#  Purpose:
#     Locate and run the Starlink installed "java" command with any
#     given arguments.

#  Description:
#     This script should be used as the "java" command when starting a
#     Starlink program. It attempts to make sure that the installed
#     version of the "java" command is used in preference to any
#     others (this increases the likelyhood that programs are only
#     executed by JVMs that they have been tested against).
#
#     The real "java" command is searched for in the following order:
#
#        - $STARLINK/java/jre/bin/java
#        - /star/java/jre/bin/java
#        - anywhere on the PATH
#
#     For development purposes it is possible to overide this
#     behaviour and force the use of a specific "java" command.
#     To do this define the variable STAR_JAVA to point at a "java"
#     command before starting this script.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.
