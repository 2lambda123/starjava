<p>Column-oriented FITS output consists of a FITS file
containing two HDUs (Header+Data Units); a primary one (required
by the FITS standard) and a single extension of type BINTABLE
containing the table data.  Unlike normal FITS format however,
this table consists of a single row in which each cell holds the
data for an entire column.
</p>

<p>This can be a more efficient format to work with when dealing with
very large, and especially very wide, tables.
The benefits are greatest when the file size exceeds the
amount of available physical memory and operations are required
which scan through the table using only a few of the columns
(many common operations,
for instance plotting two columns against each other,
fall into this category).
The overhead for reading and writing this format is somewhat
higher than for normal FITS however, and other applications may not
be able to work with it (though it is a legal FITS file), so in most
cases normal FITS is a more suitable choice.

<p>There are two variants of this format:
<dl>
<dt>colfits-plus</dt>
<dd><p>The primary HDU contains an array of bytes which stores the
    table metadata in VOTable format.
    </p></dd>
<dt>colfits-basic</dt>
<dd><p>The primary HDU contains no data.
    </p></dd>
</dl>
