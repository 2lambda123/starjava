A set of tutorials for the Diva canvas. Each class in this package is
a small, self-contained example illustrating how to use one key aspect
of the canvas. The tutorials are further broken into small methods,
each illustrating one key point. The Javadoc can be read to get an
understanding of what these examples do. Each class is explained at a
slightly higher level in the canvas tutorial document, accessible from
the <b>Packages</b> pages of the Diva documentation.

<p> For a slightly larger example, see the package
<b>diva.canvas.demo</b>.
