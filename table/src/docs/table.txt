The table package currently contains a tablecopy application which
can copy tables from one format to another, using
the facility of the StarTable package for data access.

The application is currently installed as the script java/bin/tablecopy
which will work on unix installations.  To get it to work on MS
operating systems you could try invoking (e.g. click on) the 
lib/table/table.jar jarfile (but see below).

This will work as it stands for FITS tables, VOTables and some others.
For JDBC tables, some JDBC setup must be done outside of the application.
Obviously, you need a database to connect to and a JDBC driver for starters.
You also need to register the drivers with the DriverManager and
ensure that java knows where to load the relevant classes.

I do this by:
 
  (a)  adding the following line to my "~/.starjava.properties" file:

          jdbc.drivers=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

  (b)  ensuring that the mysql-connector-java-3.0.6-stable-bin.jar file
       which contains that class is included in my CLASSPATH environment
       variable.

Since your CLASSPATH variable is ignored when you invoke a jar file
directly (java -jar or clicking on it in MS Windows), 
I don't currently know how you could use JDBC in the table
viewer by invoking the jar file directly.  This may mean that a 
custom script is required on MS operating systems (I don't know how
to write it a generic one).

Table locations can be specified on the command line.  
A URL-like format is used in which characters after 
a "#" character specify a sublocation in the file (or whatever it is).
The format is:

   JDBC:
      <URL-for-JDBC-connection>#<sql-query-text>


   FITS:
      <URL-or-filename-of-FITS-file>[#<hdu-index>]
         - primary HDU is 0, first extension is 1
         - if #<hdu-index> is absent it picks up the first table extension
         

   VOTable:
      <URL-or-filename-of-VOTable-document>[#<table-index>]
         - tables are indexed in a breadth-first way, first table found is 0;
         - if #<table-index> is absent it picks up the first TABLE element
         - eventually <table-index> ought to be replaced by an XPath query
