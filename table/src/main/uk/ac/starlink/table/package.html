Defines an interface for astronomical table formats.

<h2>Cell contents</h2>
<p>The StarTable interface, like the JTable interface, allows each cell
in a table to contain any Object.  However, if all you know about
something is that it is an Object, there is not much useful that 
you can do with it.  A JTable by default looks for a number of
types of objects and displays them specially (Dates, primitive wrapper
objects), but anything else is just turned into a string using its
<tt>toString</tt> method.

<p>This package knows about a number of additional types, as listed
below.  There is no requirement that the contents of a cell be one
of these, but the classes in this package may be expected to deal
sensibly with objects of these types, while other objects will just
be treated as simple objects - turned into strings and not much else.
It is therefore a good idea to have your <tt>StarTable</tt>s 
present their data in accordance with the following guidelines.

<ul>
<li>Single numbers may be represented by one of the primitive wrapper types:
    <pre>
    Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double
    </pre>
    or as single-element numeric arrays:
    <pre>
    byte[1], short[1], int[1], long[1], float[1], double[1]
    </pre>
    These two forms are considered equivalent.
<li>A 1-element object array is treated the same as the object itself.
<li>A 1-dimensional array should be represented as a normal java array;
    an array of primitives should be used rather than an array of wrapper
    objects where applicable (that is, use float[] not Float[]).
<li>An array of characters should be represented as a String.
<li>A 2-d array of characters should be represented as String[] array.
<li>An N-dimensional array of objects or primitives should be represented
    as a ShapedArray (though this won't be possible if it has more than
    Integer.MAX_VALUE elements)
<li>A ShapedArray with one dimension (a 1-element dims array) is treated
    the same as a normal java array.
</ul>
It is recommended that complex numbers are represented in the same
way as non-complex ones but with an extra dimension of size 2.
