/**
 * Describes the contents of all the bins used in a matching operation.
 * This is basically a mapping from bin id (one of the objects
 * returned from a {@link MatchEngine#getBins} call) to a list of rows.
 *
 * <p>The way you would normally use it is for each row you are 
 * interested in, call {@link MatchEngine#getBins}, and then
 * associate it with each of the returned bins by calling 
 * {@link #putRowInBin} on this object.
 * When you're done, you can call {@link #addRowLinks} to find all the
 * distinct sets of rows that appear as bin contents.
 * Because of the declared semantics of the <tt>getBins</tt> call, 
 * what this gives you is a list of all the groups of rows which 
 * might be mutually matching according to the
 * {@link MatchEngine#matchScore} method.
